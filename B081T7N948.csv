0,4.0,Works well on some surfaces,"This is my first experience with this type of product, so I don't know if my technique needs improvement. This worked very well on surfaces inside my house, the fine gray house dust just went away with a quick press and remove of this product. In my wife's car, it didn't seem to have enough stickiness to pull away the lint and dust. I suspect that some type of sealer for the plastic surfaces may have been used when she had the car detailed a while back. I remember just a few days after the detailing, there was a sticky feel to the dashboard and other interior surfaces. Even blue painters tape couldn't pull away the dust however, so it's not the fault of this product. So be aware it may not work on some surfaces that have been treated with ""sealers""."
1,5.0,Impressive,"This worked better than I expected. I hated that I couldn't angle my vacuum enough to pick up all of the crumbs in my center console, but this did the trick. Also I won't have to pull out the vacuum as often using this stuff. The jar is small enough to fit in the glove compartment, so I can keep it in the car. I suspect in the hotter months it may dry out but not sure. It does instruct not to leave it in direct sunlight and keep in a dry place. I cleaned it off and got most of the crumbs out by cleaning it under running water.All in all I would say it was worth the effort. I'm excited to see what else I can use it on.Oh and I like the smell of it, its kinda good. That is however subjective."
2,5.0,Good but not so much if it's cold-Vine Review.,"Honest Vine Review-It does get loose dust and dirt from inside cracks. I took a small piece of gel out of the container, had to warm it up in my hands a bit since it's on the colder side in my house right now, then used it on the back of my fan (shown before and after in my review pics) then also used the same piece on a small wall vent, by rolling it which made it very quick and easy. You can't quite tell how dirty the gel is after doing those two things, but I definitely threw it away because of how icky it was. Look forward to using this in my car when I get it back from the shop!:))"
3,4.0,Overall good product.,I like this product overall. It’s easy to use.  There’s no leftover residue after using on any surface.  The only complaint I have is that it’s not sticky enough.  I found myself having to over the dawn area 3-3 times to pick up crumbs and such.
4,4.0,Great for getting dirt out of small spaces!,This gel does an amazing job cleaning the dirt out of the small crevices in my car. It picks up so many pieces of dirt that I would typically miss when vacuuming or using a wipe.
5,4.0,Effective but pricey --,"Excellent results pulling out embedded dust from nook & crannies, deep crevices and corners that even a Miele vacuum and/or damp microfiber cloth leaves behind. Sorry for not taking ""before"" pics: I'm a well-documented clean freak, got on a roll and attacked our condo like a kid running outside after a rainstorm. (((After playing with it a few minutes it was easy to see it was essentially ""slime"" and did not leave any residue on my hands -- or anything else.))) Purchased specifically to clean furniture that, again, nothing else tackled. But. It's fairly soiled after only the first run. So the $7.99 price tag for a small jar with an expiration date in 11 months -- problematic with the second jar I bought for the car -- has inspired me to whip up a batch of slime for cheap. Hence the shaved star."
6,5.0,Best. Stuff. EVER.,"Well, for cleaning, at least. Gets up all of the dirt and random crumbs that somehow make their way into every crevice that I didn't know was there until it filled itself with dirt. Doesn't leave a sticky residue. There's plenty - I actually split it with my daughter and my mum and still have a golf ball sized bit, which has lasted forever somehow."
7,4.0,Cleaner slime,It is amazing. Does not stick your hand but picked up all the small stuff. WouldBut again
