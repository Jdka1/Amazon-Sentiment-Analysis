0,4.0,Works well on some surfaces,"This is my first experience with this type of product, so I don't know if my technique needs improvement. This worked very well on surfaces inside my house, the fine gray house dust just went away with a quick press and remove of this product. In my wife's car, it didn't seem to have enough stickiness to pull away the lint and dust. I suspect that some type of sealer for the plastic surfaces may have been used when she had the car detailed a while back. I remember just a few days after the detailing, there was a sticky feel to the dashboard and other interior surfaces. Even blue painters tape couldn't pull away the dust however, so it's not the fault of this product. So be aware it may not work on some surfaces that have been treated with ""sealers""."
1,5.0,Impressive,"This worked better than I expected. I hated that I couldn't angle my vacuum enough to pick up all of the crumbs in my center console, but this did the trick. Also I won't have to pull out the vacuum as often using this stuff. The jar is small enough to fit in the glove compartment, so I can keep it in the car. I suspect in the hotter months it may dry out but not sure. It does instruct not to leave it in direct sunlight and keep in a dry place. I cleaned it off and got most of the crumbs out by cleaning it under running water.All in all I would say it was worth the effort. I'm excited to see what else I can use it on.Oh and I like the smell of it, its kinda good. That is however subjective."
2,5.0,Good but not so much if it's cold-Vine Review.,"Honest Vine Review-It does get loose dust and dirt from inside cracks. I took a small piece of gel out of the container, had to warm it up in my hands a bit since it's on the colder side in my house right now, then used it on the back of my fan (shown before and after in my review pics) then also used the same piece on a small wall vent, by rolling it which made it very quick and easy. You can't quite tell how dirty the gel is after doing those two things, but I definitely threw it away because of how icky it was. Look forward to using this in my car when I get it back from the shop!:))"
3,4.0,Overall good product.,I like this product overall. It’s easy to use.  There’s no leftover residue after using on any surface.  The only complaint I have is that it’s not sticky enough.  I found myself having to over the dawn area 3-3 times to pick up crumbs and such.
4,4.0,Great for getting dirt out of small spaces!,This gel does an amazing job cleaning the dirt out of the small crevices in my car. It picks up so many pieces of dirt that I would typically miss when vacuuming or using a wipe.
5,4.0,Effective but pricey --,"Excellent results pulling out embedded dust from nook & crannies, deep crevices and corners that even a Miele vacuum and/or damp microfiber cloth leaves behind. Sorry for not taking ""before"" pics: I'm a well-documented clean freak, got on a roll and attacked our condo like a kid running outside after a rainstorm. (((After playing with it a few minutes it was easy to see it was essentially ""slime"" and did not leave any residue on my hands -- or anything else.))) Purchased specifically to clean furniture that, again, nothing else tackled. But. It's fairly soiled after only the first run. So the $7.99 price tag for a small jar with an expiration date in 11 months -- problematic with the second jar I bought for the car -- has inspired me to whip up a batch of slime for cheap. Hence the shaved star."
6,5.0,Best. Stuff. EVER.,"Well, for cleaning, at least. Gets up all of the dirt and random crumbs that somehow make their way into every crevice that I didn't know was there until it filled itself with dirt. Doesn't leave a sticky residue. There's plenty - I actually split it with my daughter and my mum and still have a golf ball sized bit, which has lasted forever somehow."
7,4.0,Cleaner slime,It is amazing. Does not stick your hand but picked up all the small stuff. WouldBut again
8,4.0,Easy Peasy,Easy to use product
9,4.0,Worked okay,It worked okay
0,3.0,An Alright Dust Remover,"I pruchased this to use in my vehicle to get into those hard to clean areas. I ended up using it in my dad's work truck to really put it to the test. He is working in a very dusty area with the red dirt....his truck was covered in the thick dust, so a perfect test of the product. He and I cleaned what we could with rags, but I wanted to try this stuff out on the creases and vents. It worked alright. Here are the pros/cons of the product from my initial test:Pros:- Ease of use: This is very easy to use. Just open it up, pull it out, and start dabbing it into the dusty areas. I found that tapping the dust to get the worst of it off before dragging it over a second time worked best.- Cleaning: This is good for loose dust. It worked really well at removing the dust in the vents and some of the corners you could not get a rag into.Cons:- Cleaning: This did not remove some of the stuck on dust that a rag would have removed. I also found that getting in tighter crevices did not work very well either. It also left a little greasy feel that may attract dust or that some people may not like on their dashes or inside their vehicles.- Cleaning the product: With as heavy of dust that was in my dad's truck, the gel got pretty dirty. I am not sure the best way to clean it, or if you can even clean it. Rags and towels are easy...just throw them into a washing machine. I'm guessing this is use until completely dirty and throw away.- Messy: This also leaves a greasy feel to your hands. With rags, you can usually minimize this, but this stuff gets all over your fingers, especially the finger you use to press it into vents.Overall, this is something that is a neat idea, but it really is not great. It worked okay at getting loose dirt and dust off of surfaces, but you could also get the same results from using something like tape or wrapping a small tool with some cloth and using cleaning agents. This might make a cheap, fun stocking stuffer if you want to get something that is different. Personally, I don't think I'll buy this again and just use rags."
1,4.0,Does the job,Works for crevice cleaning
2,4.0,Very sticky at first,I’ve used it on the trim on kitchen cabinets and it works great for that.
3,4.0,Clean,I use this product it in the consul area which is really hard to get a little granules out of everybody’s in their car and it cleaned the steering wheel and the radio area real nice
4,5.0,Feels weird but works,"It's sticky but yet doesn't leave anything on you at the same time, pulls up dust no matter how weird the area, and it doesn't smell bad, almost a mens shaving cream smell to it."
5,5.0,Get it!!,You think you don’t need it but you do!  You think it’s a waste of money but it’s not!  Buy one! Keep it in your car.  It has a fresh smell and cleans the cup holders and door handles so easily!
6,4.0,great product,"easy to use, works fine"
7,5.0,Great cleaning keyboards,Kinda like a paint cleaning clay but more pliable. Words great on keyboards and would imagine it will work on pulling most dust and dirt off of any hard to clean surface.
8,4.0,Helpful,"The product performed fairly well. I found that trying to manipulate the product for use in small spaces didn’t work well. My fingers were routinely breaking through. I’m not disappointed I made the purchase. I didn’t have incredibly high expectations, so it was worth the money."
9,4.0,gets in crevasses,"Good for getting crumbs, dust etc. from the dashboard, crevasses and vents in my car. Somewhat tacky or sticky feel but doesn't leave a residue that I've noticed. Doesn't clean spilled/dried coffee but I didn't expect it to. Good fun small gift too."
0,4.0,Regular..,"Es facil de usar, pero me hubiera gustado que fuera mas pegajosa, pues no limpia del todo bien."
1,5.0,"Great for hair, crumbs, and dust","This product worked as advertised. I used it in my car and it worked well to clean up hair, dust, crumbs, and inside smaller spaces. It was kinda fun to shove it into the holes to collect stuff. I was also able to use it on my cloth seats to pick up stuff. I’d recommend!"
2,4.0,Champion Crumb Catcher,"If you have crumbs in your remote control or keyboard or car dash or gear shifter, this will get them out.But as far a 'cleaning' these items- no this is not the end all I was hoping for... so, I don't have crumbs on my keyboard now, but I still had to use the q-tip with alcohol to clean it."
3,5.0,Great use of time,"Bought this on a Prime Day.  Didn't know I needed it.  It works pretty well at picking up the dust and particles.  Depends on the surface.  Not perfect but better than what I was doing before.The best part, when I'm stuck in traffic or waiting for a train, I get this out and clean my car.  Great distraction while I'm waiting."
4,4.0,Works great,It works great except it stuck to my car seat cover on a very hot day; I learned my lesson and wait until it’s cooler. I use it to remove dog hair and dust and it works very well.
5,4.0,Did a good job on my ergonomic keyboard,"To be fair, I was hoping for a miracle clean.  The pad on my keyboard is made of some soft-ish plastic with an engraved grid.  It holds dust, dirt, and even glitter forever.  I've tried various cleaning substances, stiff brushes, etc., with little effect.  It was just gross.  I saw an ad for this crevice cleaner, and it was reasonably priced, so I tried it, and I must say, it did a good job.  While I was hoping it would magically lift everything off in one swoop, I did have to use it multiple times in small areas, followed by some digging with a sharp object into that stupid grid.  And it left a little greasy feel that took a couple of days to disappear.  But... that keyboard is the cleanest it's been since I took it out of its box.  So for me, this is a good product that I'll use to keep the keyboard from getting gross again.  No miracles, but, yeah, it worked well."
6,5.0,Wierd Cleaning Experience,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but this stuff really works!  Now I am looking for additional cleaning options to use with it."
7,5.0,Easy and effective cleaner.,This gel is really great for getting into those hard to reach places! It is easy to use and picks up dirt and dust really well. It has a mild pleasant odor and doesn't leave any residue on your hands or on the surface being cleaned. Great buy!
8,4.0,Good just needs improvement,Need to be able to clean the putty after using it.
9,4.0,Great for the small crevices in my car,I use this to clean those hard to clean areas of my car like the air vents or cracks around my radio casing. It does a good job. I bought it as a prime day special and was well worth the money.
0,5.0,Good stuff,I never have one of thisAnd I found that is not geese or leaving a film in my handsSimple great product
1,4.0,Not sticky,Seems to work well.
2,4.0,Fun way of getting some of the stuff,"Got this product just to check it out. It comes in a jar and you can take as much or as little out. It works great in picking up hair and crumbs in the console areas. It would not remove the dust in the air vents. The stickiness lasted surprisingly long, after kneading it a bit everytime you picked up a bunch of lint etc. It would probably be easier to just use a moist rag.  But it wouldn't be as much fun ""sliming"" your car."
3,5.0,Awesome cleaning tool.,"Awesome cleaning for small cracks and crevices as well as larger surfaces.  Glad I bought 2.  One for the house, one for the car."
4,5.0,Very easy to use,"I used this product to clean the interior of my car, and it got rid of all the dust and little crumbs found inside my car."
5,4.0,Product helps with hard to vacuum places,"Used this in my car in between seats and it worked like a charm, hard to get it clean for any additional uses but works well for at least the first few uses."
6,4.0,This item is as described.,This item is as described.
7,5.0,Works great,"Simple, easy to use. Gets in places you otherwise have a hard time cleaning."
8,5.0,Great product. Doesn’t smell bad like others. Works very well,Great for cleaning corners and tight areas in your car or keyboard
9,5.0,Quality,It’s Ana amazing product that helps me get my car clean for a long time
0,5.0,moves so easy,I REALLY LIKE THIS SO EASY TO CLEan car and keyboard
1,4.0,"Over all great, gets the little things",Used - absolutely great!
2,5.0,Great cleaning stuff!,I love this for cleaning those hard to get to areas in my car!
3,5.0,Happy Customer,"I’ll be honest - I was a bit hesitant to buy this after I saw some of the reviews. But, I did it anyways and i’m so glad I did!! This stuff WORKS! Immediately cleaned my computer and car, and i’m insanely happy with this purchase. Picks up tons of dirt and is very reusable. I love it!!"
4,5.0,I'm primarily commenting on how quickly it was dispatched and delivered.,I bought this product because I was already familiar with it.  I'm primarily commenting on how quickly it was dispatched and delivered.
5,5.0,Gel for car,Works great to get dust and little crumbs out!
6,4.0,Great for Cleaning Dash & Around Buttons and Controls,"This stuff works great for cleaning the dash & around buttons and controls in your car, but a couple of tips:  1)  Be careful with this stuff and fabric (like your clothes, for example) - it will adhere too well to cloth, and 2)  when using it on your open car doors, I recommend placing a towel on the ground underneath, or, if / when you drop the slime,too much debris from your garage floor or driveway will stick to it.  Otherwise, it is easy to use and very effective, particularly on car speaker grills which never seem to get clean any other way."
7,5.0,Cleanest My Keyboard Has Been In Years,"I'm not what you'd call a neat freak, but enough was enough. My desktop is in my bedroom, just a couple feet away from the dog's bed. My daughter's cat also puts in an occasional appearance. And if that wasn't sufficient, I've been known to snack while typing, which is probably a mistake. But even if none of these things was true, eventually a lot of lint and debris settles between the keys, and eventually liquid air will not get everything clean again.I found this stuff on a lightning deal, and since it didn't cost much, I thought I'd give it a try. Unlike the illustration I saw that shows the entire can of it dumped out onto the keyboard, I decided to use just a small amount and see if it is really necessary to use it all up in one go. It isn't. I took a glob about the size of a marble, maybe an inch and a half around or so, and I squished it up till it was warm and pliable. Then I rolled it over the tops of the keys; not only did they look cleaner, but after a few repetitions, they began to shine, which I didn't expect. So cool! Once it was good and soft, I began squishing it all the way down between the keys. (You will know you have succeeded when you have to give a little tug to get it out again.) I didn't disconnect my keyboard from the computer, nor did I shut it off. I did, however, open a new window before I began, lest I do something unforeseen in cyberspace while cleaning; yikes! I continued squishing and tugging till the whole keyboard was (pretty) clean; I'd give it 90% after about half an hour of squishing and pulling. I'll attach pictures and you can see. First, the dirt; then, the process; the clean version; and the goo after use. Not one tiny speck of blue goo remained down there; it all came up in one piece, every single time. When I was done, there was a little pet hair on the surface of the blue goo, but the most obvious sign that the dirt had transferred from the keyboard to the goo, came when I tried returning the goo to the container. It is a totally different color, almost an ocean green! Needless to say, I am not going to keep it in the container for reuse; the used portion is getting thrown away. However, unless I decide to use it to clean a lot  of other things, this one modest container will last me for years. What a deal! Highly recommended."
8,5.0,Great buy,Loved how well crumbs etc. stuck to the product. Fun to use to clean the computer keyboard.
9,4.0,Somewhat helpful,It worked but not as sticky as expected.  Did not remove all dust.
0,5.0,Useful,Just like advertised. Get the nooks n crannies of your car stereo and door buttons clean. Easily clean computer keyboard. Residue one might expect from such a product was minimal imo
1,5.0,Seems to do the job but have only been using for about a week,Easy to work with and get into places that are difficult to reach by other cleaning methods.
2,4.0,Works very well,The only thing I don't like is you can't wash the old dirt off of the gel. It makes it very messy and dirty.
3,5.0,Great product for the money,I purchased to clean my keyboards and small areas in the cars. Works great!
4,4.0,Good for my keyboard,I used this on my keyboard and found it work really well.  It was easy to use and I have been able use it more than once
5,5.0,Works as advertised...,Love it for the hard to wipe out areas.
6,4.0,Great for maintenance,"So I like this product. It is a good maintenance product, once your car has been thoroughly cleaned. It is not a product to clean your car, but one that helps maintain a clean car. I just pull off a small piece to use on my vents, dash, console etc. I will be purchasing again once this jar runs out."
7,5.0,Outstanding Quality. Fast Shipping. Great Seller.,Outstanding Quality. Fast Shipping. Great Seller. Does what it says. Would buy from this seller again.
8,4.0,"Great idea,  does an ok job","This products works well on computer keyboards. That’s the one application where I’ll continue to use it. It dies an ok job on the nooks and crannies of my car dashboard, but a brush attachment on my vacuum is easier and does just as good a job."
9,4.0,Worked well,Worked well on computer keyboard
0,3.0,Not the miracle I expected,"I wasn’t super impressed with this. I used it in my car, first in the cup holder. Yes, it got some surface dirt, but not any of the built up gunk. I then ran it across my dashboard. Again, it got some surface dirt, but I’ll still need to clean it again with a more powerful product. It doesn’t seem worth it to me to use this, then have to follow up with additional cleaners."
1,4.0,Generally works,Product  is hard to get into some areas like corners because you need to press firmly and directly down into area. Also did not always pick up everything even after several attempts. Need a rag and possibly some cleaner to wipe down any shiny or clear things it touches because it will leave a film. It also will leave some bits of it in some tight spaces and can be hard to get out.
2,4.0,Nice to have in the tool kit.,"This is not the end all be all…but, it certainly gets into hard to reach crevices. I’ll certainly buy again."
3,4.0,It smells nice,"Okay, so I probably could have used my kids slime and gotten the same results, but this smelled nice and if I wasn't so opposed to dusting it would have lasted more than one use.Then again, it would have lasted more than one use but my weirdness wouldn't allow me to put it back in the container with all that dirt and dust and whatever else was in it. That's my bad.Overall, I would do it again simply because it's easy to use. If you need to scrub something, this isn't the product for that. But it is a quick way to clean off the dash."
4,5.0,Huge Sticky Mess,"I used this a few times on my three cars and after putting it back in the jar and getting it back out for another cleaning it was incredibly sticky, gooey to the point that it had a mucous like consistency and I struggled to get it off my hands, clothing and anything it came in contact with. I had to wipe it off with a microfiber towel that I threw in the trash, wash it off in the sink and throw the jar away. I've used other car cleaning gel products that did not do this. I would NOT recommend this product, it is NASTY!!!"
5,5.0,Just as awesome as I thought!,Just as often as I thought!
6,5.0,Lo maximo,Lo mejor para limpiar cualquier rincon de tu carro
7,4.0,Works Great On Computer Keyboards Too!,"This stuff is fantastic for getting into tight spaces. Used it on my car's AC vents, then used it on some computer keyboards.  Just pressed it in between the keys and it pulled out all sorts of gunk."
8,5.0,UNBLEIVABLE!,"I saw this product advertised on TV and just had to try it. This stuff cleans where no other tool or crevice cleaner can go. Only one word is good enough for this product, FANTASTIC! In fact, I am buying another can to use around my house. The can sets perfectly in the center console cup holder for easy use. This product is habit forming. Dab here and dab there for a dust free car or whatever. Dust on a keyboard does not stand a chance. Great product."
9,4.0,"Easy to use, cleans nicely",Vehicle tough crevices we're cleaned easily & quickly
0,5.0,Great product,Easy to use!
1,4.0,I think it will do the job.,I think it will do the job.
2,5.0,This works this product works.  Good for hard to clean places,This product works for hard to clean places
3,5.0,Really cool goo,I love this stuff!! Gets all the dust and dirt off my dash with a simple roll over it. Love that it gets everything without using sprays or cleaners.
4,4.0,"Very intereting, but does what it says it will do","It doesn't come with directions, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I've determined that it's not something you probably want to reuse, but I'm not sure if others do. I bought it to clean the dust and dirt from the cup holders in my car to get me to when I can get a proper detail job done. I tore a bit of the glob out of the jar and rolled it around the cup holders and it cleaned it very well. Maybe someone with more patience than I would get a perfect clean, but I'm impatient and got a 4.8 out of 5 star clean in just a few minutes total for both cup holders. I'm happy with my purchase and will probably continue to use this."
5,4.0,Work's Great,It worked great but still doesn't pick up some older messes.  I still love it for cracks and crevices.
6,5.0,If you don't get you some of this,"All I can say is WOW I'm glad I bought the blue and purple ones cause this stuff works wonders. If you smoke in your car and have ash or tobacco in the lil drink cubbies or the inside for handle pockets you NEED to buy you some of these. I was so shook when I watched that stuff that reminded me of my youth when Slime came out. Not only does it work amazingly its also fun to use and is resuable. If I had one thing to say bad it's that the small print and my old eyes are at odds,  I cannot read the jar or instructions on how to use it,  so I winged it and it worked.  I just pulled the entire wad out of the container and just started sticking into the drink holders in my car now it's spotless but since I had fun doing it the other day I'm gonna have to go get the rest done so I can post it on the ad.  I still have more to do and will try and put up a lil video of how well this stuff works!!! Plus it's pocketbook friendly knowing what I know now if they decide to do what must business are doing these days in raising prices due to inflation from the global pandemic and how it's changed life as we know it,  but I hope they don't cause they will still get rich on this product keeping the price where it was when I bought mine and will buy more and will stay a customer well into the future."
7,4.0,This gel is easy to handle and works.,"I used the gel to get dust, animal hair and other small specs of dirt out of the vents, cover around the shifter, seams of seats, dashboard, media display screen, cup holders, media holders and was well pleased with the results.  I had to use a multi surface wipe to pick up some of the dog har and grass, but the gel pulled everything out of hard to clean spaces. It did not stick or break up and went back into the jar perfectly."
8,4.0,Novel idea that works well,"I keep the gel in my glovebox where I do not have a vacuum, it works great. It works great for my kids seat booster in the back. The only reason I took one star off was because honestly it’s not the easiest to clean. That being said, it’s well work it"
9,4.0,Nice for cleaning!,"It’s a nice gift, it’s easy to use for cleaning your car or small crumbs. It’s takes a while to get in deep cracks, you’ll have to let the slime sit for a while. But other than that it’s easy to remove. ❤️"
0,5.0,Easy to use!,"100%  satisfied, does exactly what I need it to!"
1,4.0,Not exactly what I was expecting.,Maybe I read the product description. I will keep this to see if it does any better cleaning on the inside of car. It's easy to use but it didn't clean what I was expecting. Good for loose dirt/dust.
2,4.0,To the Last,"This product has enabled me to do much-improved detailing.  It certainly works great in tight, irregularly-shaped areas.  Love it."
3,5.0,Great product,Just as advertised.
4,5.0,Me encanto El producto,Todo me gusto
5,5.0,As expected,Multi dust cleaner. Just use as it was intended and you will be satified
6,3.0,Useful but not as useful as I'd hoped,"It picks up dust a small debris with relative ease but didn't do anything for the grime on my keyboard. Was hoping to avoid using a cleaner but I will have to it seems. Worked great in my car cup holder and nooks and crannies on the dash and seats. If this is what you're looking for, I recommend it!"
7,4.0,Works well,I use this for my car to get the dust and such. It picks up most easily. It has a pleasant smell too
8,4.0,Works,Did good to clean my car vents and get up dust.
9,4.0,Used it on tv,I used it on the TV and it worked good for getting dust out of the vents and dips around buttons.  I used it on blinds but it wouldn't roll right because I couldn't put pressure on blinds. I tried it on a glass top coffee table because there's a space between the glass and the wood of table.  Crack was too narrow.  Couldn't get goo to go in Crack to clean.  So I guess it's best just for dusting things that don't have a smooth surface
0,5.0,It Works,"It works fine to remove dirt and dust in hard to reach places.My only question is ""How long will it last?"""
1,5.0,I love it,Worked as advertised
2,4.0,This stuff just works,"This stuff just works, for getting that crud that falls in the cracks not perfect but 90%"
3,5.0,Great product,Works as advertised! Grabs the hard to reach and often cruddy nooks and crannies
4,5.0,like,"Item was of high-standard quality! Notably prime delivery. The packaging was very, very resplendent."
5,5.0,Easy to use,Works well
6,5.0,will buy again,very happy
7,4.0,Pretty cool tool,"For OCD people who hate cleaning the louvers on their car's vents or around the keys on a remote control device or computer keyboard, this thing is excellent! I haven't determined yet how long I can use it before it becomes so full of dust and lint that it is unusable, but I'm pretty happy with it so far."
8,4.0,Cool product,"I used this product on my laptop and inside my carIt did an awesome job cleaning my filthy car, will be purchasing again in the future"
9,4.0,Cleaning gel works,It got most of the dirt out of the cracks.  In some instances a small brush was better
0,3.0,It was ok,Was not as thorough as I thought it would be. Did pull out a good amount of stuff from hard to reach places in the car. But definitely did not get everything. Will still need to go back and vacuum. So with that probably not worth it
1,5.0,Good productive,Good product does the job it’s advertised for.
2,4.0,amazing product,"I love this product, it works so well at cleaning the little parts"
3,3.0,Mediocre,It does okay. I wouldn't say this is great for deep cleaning. Also wish it had instructions for cleaning it. I'm guessing soap and water but that's not clearly on the label that I could find. It didn't pick up crumbs in my car that are in the crevices of the gear shift but it did get hair and fibers that were around the gear shifter. Don't expect miracles but if you get it on sale it could be useful.
4,4.0,This stuff works !,"Interior of Wife's car is beast to clean- black shows all of the dust/dirt (contrast)  - this car cleaning gel gets  it all up , even out of the nooks and crannies. Good Stuff, will purchase again."
5,5.0,Gets the smallest dirt out.,Easy product to use.
6,4.0,Easy to use!,I like it! It really does clean and doesn’t smell bad.
7,3.0,Same as slime,It's just like the slim kids buy. And you an get it really cheap at the dollar tree.  It was a good idea though. Smells clean and is stretchy. My friends daughter took it over.
8,4.0,Removed difficult crud from car interior,"This seems like the slime/goo that my kids used to play with. It may be the exact same stuff from the toy store, but it works. It got rid of a lot of crud stuck in the crevices, steering wheel, and cup holder in my car. It didn't get all of it, but probably 90 percent. My car looks much better. I am going to have to get a needle or something for the remaining goobers in crevices. Would purchase again."
9,4.0,not for modern keyboards,"It was thicker than others i have used and did not work for cleaning either of my computer keyboards. It was too thick to get down between the keys well, ad too heavy to sit on the top of the keys without pushing them down in where the goo could not get the dust stuck to the sides. It did work well on the vets of my air purifiers, game controllers, ad that annoying ledge on the PS4 that is such a pain to dust."
0,5.0,very cheap,really awesome product
1,5.0,"It's a gift card, so what?","I thought I'd try this as a stocking stuffer for my nephew who is into cars.  Don't know if he'll use it, but I know he won't be expecting it."
2,4.0,"PIcks up great, doesnt clean itself easily","I like this product.  It cleans well and leaves no residue.  The smell, color, and texture are all pleasant.  I do not like the fact that it is tricky to clean.  I have tried washing this product in warm water with and without soap.  the bits it picks up often stay in the putty.  so works great initially but does get dirty over time. its a good product."
3,5.0,Works as described,Perfect
4,5.0,Works as it is supposed to,Easy to use
5,3.0,Turned into slime,"It worked great the first two times I used it--on my work keyboard and my laptop keyboard, but when I tried to use it a third time it had turned into a slimy mess that wouldn't come off of my hands.  I had to throw it away."
6,4.0,Icky Sticky Stuff!,"Soooo....This stuff is hard to use. It is very sticky and adheres to your hands making it hard to use. I did find that the more I ""cleaned"" with it, the easier it became to use. It needs to be a little ""dirty"" in order to be effective and easier to use.  Not something I would purchase again."
7,5.0,Love This Stuff!,"The first time I used this product, I felt like a kid at Christmas. I can't believe how something so simple can handle hard-to-clean things so easily. I will definitely be ordering more."
8,3.0,Ehh,This did well to pick up larger items but it doesn’t go into the cracks as well as I’d like so it really only cleans the surface.
9,4.0,As advertised,N/A
0,3.0,not as good as I hoped,It does not deep clean like it said.  It also can get struck on items making it another mess instead of something that cleans.
1,3.0,This works the first couple of times,"This works the first couple of times. However, when it gets really dirty, there’s really no way to get the dirt out of it. If you try and wash it or take a paper towel to try and get it off, it gets sticky and doesn’t work anymore. I will not be buying this product again I was disappointed."
2,5.0,Great for detail cleaning,I used this in my car and it did well there and then i used it inside on my laptop and it looks brand new now....very easy to use and i figured out if you warm it up and use your fingers for those hard to reach areas it does great
3,3.0,Just OK,It works ok but I am a particular detailer and prefer tiny brushes that can get into small cracks. The gel doesn’t get deep enough for my liking. If you are not particular then this is quick and pretty effective
4,5.0,It totally works.,"My family recently took a road trip. Crumbs everywhere in the backseat. This stuff cleaned it all up easily and picked up all the dog hair and dust as well. It's reusable, but, I'm not sure how to clean it because it didn't come with directions. Some of it was sealed outside of the jar but it was a sealed packaged that was airtight enough that it was still as functional as what was sealed inside the jar. Weird, but, also very cool."
5,5.0,"Easy peasy, lemon squeezy","Easy to use, easy to clean. Super easy to pick up dog hair."
6,3.0,Not a fan,Leaves pieces and sticky residue on your surfaces. Didn’t like it as much as I thought I would.
7,4.0,Worked ok on dusty area,Liked that it is easy to use.
8,4.0,Easy touse.,Picks up tiny dirt in cracks.
9,5.0,It works,It works
0,5.0,Excellent product,Thank you
1,4.0,Worked great on my keyboard!,"This removed all the lint left behind when I tried cleaning my keyboard with a cleaning wipe. It does have a chemical odor though, so you'll need to wash your hands afterwards.  I didn't have any product residue on my hands like I read in some reviews."
2,5.0,Easy and Fun to Use,"The product arrived the day after I ordered it which was nice. I thought it would be over-slimy or that it would stick to my hands but it came out perfectly with no residue left on me when I put it back. So far I have just used it in my dusty car, but personally, I really enjoy it."
3,3.0,Just ok,I don’t feel like it picks up dust like I expected it to
4,5.0,Slime me,This ball of slime works really well and last a good while
5,4.0,Works pretty good,It works pretty good. Not perfect.  Interesting product.
6,4.0,Nothing,Easy to use . Dusts very well
7,4.0,Awesome product,This product is amazing to remove sand from hard to reach areas of the dash… I’m amazed how fast and easy it is to use..
8,5.0,Works wonderfully!,Awesome product that allowed me to get dust and crumbs from even the toughest spots.  Even my various vacuum attachments weren’t able to get all the places this stuff does.  Highly recommend to anyone who loves a clean vehicle.
9,5.0,Weirdly amazing,This stuff works amazing. I live and drive on gravel roads . My vehicle is always dusty. This thing cleans up the doors and dash amazing.
0,4.0,Works surprisingly well!,"This is a cheap and lazy solution for car cleaning. When I’m being serious about cleaning my car I’ll get the vacuum out, but this little blob will do when I’m in a bind. It picks up dust and dirt from small crevices pretty well. My main complaint is that it has a weird perfume-y smell to it that I don’t like. I wish it was just unscented. Also it obviously won’t last that long and will need to be thrown out after several uses so it’s a little wasteful."
1,4.0,messy,not as easy to use
2,4.0,It’s slime,"Not the miracle product it claims to be, but it’s better than regular dusting. I think kids’ slime would do the same thing."
3,5.0,It works!!!,This stuff is Amazing 🤩 I used it to clean my makeup case and it was sparkling in seconds. Took it out to the car too.... magical. I'll be a forever customer 😃
4,5.0,I was pleasently surprised!,"I wasn't sure if this was going to work in my car. I hate detailing the inside, it's such a tedious task. For how dirty/dusty inside my car, I was really surprised at how much of a difference it made using this product. Definitely going to be getting more!"
5,5.0,Good product,This is a great little product that will make your car cleaning much more satisfying. It's all the little stuff that you can't reach with anything else. It was a good purchase for me!
6,4.0,Easy to use in tough places,It did a good job on my tough to clean areas; console & tough to reach areas.
7,5.0,Surprisingly good,Very easy to use
8,3.0,Good for cup holders,It was easy to use. But it was wet. New truck left streaks on my dash. I put it back in the container & dumped in the trash. It could be used for cup holders & would probably work well. I don’t recommend for visual places though as I had to reclean
9,3.0,It cleans,It cleans but leaved remains.
0,3.0,It was great at first.,"Now that I’ve used it for about a month, the substance is becoming more a gooey sticky mess.  It sticks to my hands, and pretty much to anything it touches.  Cold or warm, it doesn’t matter.  I find that if I take it out of the container and work it with my hands it helps, but still kind of a gooey mess.  I may jut toss it out."
1,4.0,Don’t except miracles,Good for what it is. Gets into vents and hard to reach areas. Don’t except it to clean everything. Still will need a wipe for the anything more then dust/lint.
2,3.0,"Good, not great","It gets the obvious, easy to reach dust, but it’s not amazing. The substance isn’t particularly sticky, so it won’t get hard to reach spots."
3,5.0,Works great!,Works wonderful for those small hard to reach areas.
4,5.0,saca toda la murge,para el interior de me auto y moto
5,4.0,Great as an added step in cleaning routine!,"I really like this product and don't mind the feeling. I think it's great but not alone to deep clean. I use it as my last step or to keep dust from accumulating. Overall very satisfied with feel, smell, and performance."
6,5.0,Products very good,Used this inside my car on the keyboards of my computer Works real well
7,5.0,Really Does a Great Job,"Love the product. Used on my dash, in my cup holders and other nook and crannies in my SUV. Did a great job!"
8,4.0,Decent enough,Works pretty well but doesn't get to everything.
9,4.0,Interesting stuff,cool conecpt.  doesn't get 100% of grime but leaves it better than before for areas you can't reach very well.
0,4.0,It's just hard to clean small crevices and this helps.,Use it all at once and put it back in the small jar.  It works well and can be used over and over. I also used it on my piano keyboard where there are several push buttons.
1,3.0,This is just slime,This is literally just slime. Any slime can't do what this does. It didn't magically pick up every thing. Had to pass over it a few times.
2,4.0,Helpful,"Useful product, love it"
3,5.0,Does amazing deep cleaning work. Does stick to some surfaces after it's gotten a little dirty,"Works as you'd expect. I used it to clean the horizontal surfaces a musical keyboard that had been sitting in a church collecting dust for years. The speaker areas were particularly dusty and came out clean with a couple of minutes work. Could not have done better with brushes and a vacuum. You can re-use this for a limited time. Once it's got a bunch of dust/dirt in it, it starts to stick to some plastic surfaces and you have to dig it out of there, so use sparingly and toss it once it starts to stick. I'm keeping this around for similar hard to reach cleaning."
4,5.0,So much fun to really get vehicle interiors clean!,"This car hadn't been cleaned in about 2 years, dog hair, coffee spills, pollen, dust, shop grease hands and feet...everything was stuck all over the interior.After a good cleaning of all surfaces with basic mild soap and water (far less soap than water) I pulled a piece off and went to work on all those weird places that are difficult to clean.It was so much fun to get the vents and tough places where grunge collects, slap it on, work it around, pull off, work the gel, repeat. Even when the sun came out as you can see in the pictures, it didn't leave residue or stick to anything. One thing I do after a good cleaning is to use a dry micro-fiber towel to pick up any dust/pollen that was blowing back into the car.It got so much stuff off I had to wash it afterwards which is also awsome since it does wash clean with soapy water...it's just tough to hang onto when you are doing that part.Totally recommend!!!!"
5,4.0,Great,Easy to use
6,3.0,It’s okay….,"This is an okay cleaning product. It’s a bit too sticky and sticks to my hands and parts of the car, takes some work to get off. Make sure the inside of your car isn’t too hot or this product will melt and stick to car. It does pick up small dust and things pretty well."
7,5.0,Works really well!,Gently dab the goo around your dash. It works great!
8,5.0,Very satisfied with this product.,It works/performs just as specified.
9,5.0,Perfect,5⭐️
0,3.0,It leaves a film behind,This product did a good job of cleaning hard to get into areas.  The disappointing part was that it left a film behind that I had to remove.
1,5.0,Easy to use,Easy to use in dusty desert
2,4.0,Does what It is supposed to,"Squishy,,hmmmmm"
3,4.0,You can only use it once!!,You can only use it once! It falls apart when you run it under water. Plus it does not give cleaning instructions!!
4,4.0,Better than nothing,I expected it to pick up everything in one try.  It works but it’s not as easy as the commercials.
5,4.0,Makes cleaning fun,Gave 4 stars because the slime does leave a slight residue on the items it comes in contact with
6,3.0,The same slime you make with your kids,"I am updating my earlier review. Customer service reached out to me quickly and sent a replacement which is great business. I was the exact same as I had received the first time but, the weather was cooler, so it worked better than the first time - I could actually smoosh it into the crevices. I'll have to see over time how it continues to work. I'm going to try to put it in the fridge for an hour or so before I use it next time to see if that makes a difference. If anyone is using it and having great success, please let me know the trick!I was so pysched to order this and finally rid my black car of all of the tiny white specs that appear and multiply.  I opened the container and realized I just spent $7 on basically the same craft project I made with my kids this summer. Still I clung to my dreams and focused on how satisfying it would be to pull away the slime and see all of those mysterious flecks of white be pulled away - fully encompassed by that life changing blue blob.Alas, my dreams floated away as i pushed that squishy blob of microwaved metamucil into the crevices of my car. As I gently pushed on the slime it refused to go where i demanded. Instead it ran to the very edges of the blob leaving a thin veil of slime under my palm - not unlike how a toddler runs away from a lamp it just broke.Luckily, I had yet to throw out my handheld vacuum, toothpicks and small rag. With those I was able to MacGyver my own detailing solution.Buy it if you need a gift for a kid. Do NOT buy if you need to clean your car."
7,5.0,Amazing,"I have not used it in my car yet, but used it on the keyboard of my computer and it got up every last crumb and lint from the whole keyboard.  I am impressed and will try it soon in the car,"
8,3.0,cleaning tools,well I haven't tried it on the car yet. I did do the keyboards & it didn't really clean that well.
9,3.0,Its ok,Have to let sit for 20mins so it will fill in fully not a quick clean and something had to do 3-4 times to fully clean
0,5.0,Great for leather short throw shift boots. Refrigerate it!!,"I read the reviews about it melting and being a problem, but it was a flash sale and super cheap so I got it. I put it in the fridge overnight and the consistency was perfect. I used it to clean my entire interior. That’s where I messed up. If your dash and doors are dusty or your car isn’t already pretty clean, this will pick everything up and get full of stuff and lose its life more quickly. It’s a detailer. Not a car cleaner. I should have used some armor all and a towel or a wipe first and used the gel afterwards to get hard to reach spots. It works amazing in vents. It seems like it was specifically made for short throw shift boots. Nothing has gotten around and in everything easier and that has always annoyed me when I’m cleaning a car. So much easier than vacuuming and scooping the debris that gets in there when the rest of your car is perfect."
1,4.0,My wife is very pleased with the product,Purchased this to get dirt out of the crevices of my wife's car. She is very happy with how it worked.
2,4.0,Car dust cleaner,It looks  the same as the Pic. It does make hands blue
3,5.0,Hassle free use and great results!,A product that is ready to use and easy to store.  Does an easy job of getting into small areas and removes dirt.  Highly recommend the product.
4,4.0,Works well on car vents.,"Found that the product worked well with getting dust from in-between car vents, but didn't pick up around gear shift and other areas so well."
5,5.0,Works well for my need,Works well for my meed
6,4.0,Good,"It is easy to use and gets in cracks, but it takes a while and once it is dirty it is hard to clean."
7,5.0,Works well if you know how to use it.,"1. Be patient, learn the speed it takes for it to creep into cracks and pull it out with the correct speed.  If you don't, the goo will not reach those places OR you will leave behind some goo.2. Pay attention to temperature.  Store and use in a good temperature.  You will just have to experiment to see what works for you.Pay attention to those two things and it will clean with no residue."
8,4.0,Would not buy again,Leaves a residue and feel sticky and stinks
9,5.0,Ease of use.,Works great. Great service.
0,4.0,nice,"bumped into this by accident on amazon and I love it, car is always taking on dust etc, you role this around a bit and all good."
1,5.0,Great!,"I used it to get the hard to reach dust and whatnot in my vents and center console, without needing a qtip. It got just about everything!! I used a little at a time and I still have quite a bit left over."
2,4.0,pick up tiny bits of dirt,I loved how it picked up all the little crumbs and dirt in the seams of my car seats.
3,5.0,Pretty convenient,This was a pretty good buy
4,5.0,Cool blob...,Made our keyboards look almost new.
5,5.0,looking clean,this cleaning gel really did a good job in cleaning my glass holder and console in my SUV plus you can reuse it again.
6,5.0,Nice!,"This product is great! It gets out all the gunk on your power window switches, leaving them just like new!"
7,4.0,It works well overall,"Product did what it needed, it could possibly be a little more sticky. It has a fragrance with it that helped make my new truck smell good. Overall a good product"
8,3.0,Underwhelming,"I ordered this stuff for a new (old) car to do some detailing.  While it is easy to use and does not get stuck anywhere, it really did not do much.  Perhaps my expectations were too high."
9,4.0,putty,works good just doesnt get small spots
0,3.0,Just kids slime,"If you're familiar with kids slime, it picks up dust and hair as well as that, because that exactly what it is. Course, you can pick up slime anywhere at a fraction of the price of this product."
1,5.0,It actually works!,I was shocked to get something like this that does work.  I was thrilled.  Used it on all my office equipment and now the car.  Great product!!!
2,5.0,Works great for dust,This works great for cleaning dust. Unfortunately it doesn't clean up sticky residue from spilled drinks.
3,4.0,Interesting!,Works great.
4,5.0,cleaning gel,"good price, arrived quick"
5,4.0,Gross but works!,Worked easily to clean the crevices of my car. Not sure if it’s a one time use because not sure how to clean the goo once I cleaned the car
6,5.0,Magical!,This cleaning gel is awesome!  It easily picks up all the crumbs in all those hard to reach places!
7,3.0,Can use basic slime instead from dollar tree,Bought this and compared it to the dollar store slime.  Works the same.  Great to get the crumbs from cracks but the other one I used worked better than this.  Plus they don't last forever as they get gross.  But overall nice to have on hand.
8,5.0,Great stuff!,The driver didn't follow instructions by putting the boxes behind the wall and out of sight of ppl passing by. Other than that all is well.
9,4.0,Great for cleaning in awkward spaces!,"Easy to use, works well, and washes off with water to reuse!"
0,3.0,Just fair,"Picks up larger pieces of dirt, crumbs, etc. Does nothing for the small, finer pieces. Overall pretty disappointing."
1,3.0,Wanted this to pick up dust and clean easily,Products ships in a glass jar with plastic wrap. It is sealed under the cap to keep it fresh. Used it to clean my computer keyboard and didn’t know if I took the whole thing out of the jar of just a small piece. I used a small amount and used it on the keyboard. It was. easy to use and fit into all the crevices. It just didn’t pick up all the dust and dirt as promised. I had to go over the keys several times. Still not perfectly clean but much better. I will try it on my car dashboard and see if it does better there.
2,5.0,magical,it’s so fun cleaning with this!
3,5.0,"This product reminds me of slime, but it really works!  No residue just clean spaces!","To seperatea bit away from the bulk is interesting.  Not hard, but just slime!  Worth it though, it works in those itty bitty places!"
4,3.0,Not worth the money,"This does a ""ok"" job.  It was interesting to try, but not worth buying more."
5,3.0,Disappointed,I had high expectations and was disappointed. It picks up dirt but not all of it even when it’s not stuck on or in a weird corner. It didn’t get stuck on anything so that was a plus but I won’t buy again.
6,3.0,A little TOO sticky,"This goop did great at picking upsand and dust. I used it in my car, around the center console area. You kinda have to squish it into where you want stuff picked up for it to really work. I had a hard time with this stuff because it stuck to my fingers so much. I don't think I would buy this again."
7,4.0,"Good for light, loose dirt","This was great in my car to remove the light dust on the dash and larger debris from my center console tray area and cup holders.  Anything that was stuck on didn't budge and it also left a chemical looking sheen on my touchscreen, but it was great for light cleaning purposes."
8,3.0,Un,Okay product. It worked
9,3.0,Didn’t measure up,It did not pick up crumbs in the edges where I pushed it down into. It didn’t stick to the point where I had a hard time removing it.
0,3.0,kind of works but not as completely as desired,"It's a pleasant to feel product that is malleable but doesn't exceptionally well pick up dust crumbs, etc."
1,4.0,Blue gel,Picks up lint and doesn’t look dirty. I like it
2,4.0,Esto es lo mismo que el juguete de mi hija,Pero funciona para limpiar mis computadoras.
3,3.0,Liquified after 7 months,"So oI went to use it today, turned the jar upside down and liquid poured out onto my keyboard.  Not a lot, but maybe a teaspoon or so.  So this apparently starts to liquify after a while. Had to throw it out. Disappointed."
4,5.0,Cleaning gel,Easy to remove from jar. Easy to use for cleaning.
5,5.0,Excellent,"This product actually works, it got out all the little dust an crumbs out of places that a normal vacuum could not get too. So too sum it up it works wonderful."
6,3.0,Not very sticky,"I used this to clean my car, but it didn’t pick up any dust. It only picks up the big crumbs."
7,4.0,Good,"Works well with collecting dust, can’t get into deep crevices tho"
8,4.0,Makes cleaning fun,"I have been looking for a cleaning goo to keep in my car for the dust and crumbs that accumulate. This one was a good deal so I thought I would try it outIt doesn't quite pick everything up and it's not as slime like as I was hoping. You have to make a couple passes. It doesn't get the stuff in corners like I hoped either, but you get what you pay for.It doesn't leave a residue behind which is good and it has a nice scent."
9,5.0,It does what it says!!!,"Great product, does exactly what it says it will do. Arrived quickly, ( happy I brought one for myself, as the others are gifts.)"
0,4.0,it works,It really works.  It is a little hard to press the gel all the way into the vents.
1,4.0,Cleaning,"Worked very well, not perfect but would recommend"
2,5.0,best jel ever,best jel ever i use it on car and clean cupholders product very useful and slimy however use a glove first to clean car
3,5.0,Works well,"I just needed to make a purchase for Prime day, and this was on the home page for $5 on sale so I figured what the heck.  Didn't really ""need"" it, at least, I didn't THINK so lol.  Turns out, it's awesome.  My keyboard keys have a lot of dust and crap accumulated on the caps at the bottoms, hard to clean.I unplugged the keyboard so my PC didn't go nuts then smooshed the slime all over.  Peeled it off, it left no residue behind and also left no dust behind :)  Nice and clean keys.  Very happy with this product!"
4,4.0,Does the job,I used it when it came it clean the dashboard and the cup holders after couple of days sitting in the car heated it was sticky to use 😅 so it’s really like a one time use but it did the job ✔️ done
5,3.0,No Instructions,I have not used this Item yet. No instruction on how to use. It was assumed I knew Lol!
6,4.0,4 of 5 - It does a good job but not fit into very slim cracks.,"4 out of 5  --  It does a good job in pockets, cup holders, vents, trim.  It does not fit into very slim cracks easily.  It reminds me a little of the ""Slime"" toy you'd buy as a kid, that if you dropped it on the carpet, it'd get stuck and you'd never get it off.  Kind of cool to use.  With rags and cleaner strips, you can never get all the dirt out of the cup holders, they don't pickup everything.  This will pickup everything.  I'm not sure how many uses I'll get out of this before it gets gross and I have to throw it out.  It's an interesting tool for detailing your interior on the car.  Maybe some other folks have some neat uses for it."
7,4.0,Handy,Easy way to clean computer keyboard.
8,3.0,Doesn’t actually pick up the dirt in the cracks,It doesn’t stick to your hands or car but also doesn’t actually get any of the little crumbs and dirt specs from the cracks in the car. We had fun playing with it though.
9,3.0,Works but not totally happy,"Mostly computer keyboard and car interior. Well, it works, but does not flow by itself to nook and crannies as the picture shows, it has to be forced in. Not as soft or malleable as I thought, but it does removes dust and small particles."
0,5.0,Awesome,I love this stuff
1,5.0,2nd time purchase!,I really like this product - the first picked up so many crumbs I has to buy a second one when it lost it’s stick!
2,3.0,Not quite as hoped for…,"The pickup power was weak though it did fine on very flat surfaces. I wanted it to squish into corners , but that was considerably less successful."
3,5.0,Easy to use,Easy to use for interior car detailing
4,4.0,Cleaner,"Great product, great service."
5,3.0,Cleaning gel,I used this in my car. It worked ok on large surfaces but not so great in the smaller crevices!
6,5.0,great product,This is such a great idea.  Everyone needs this!
7,3.0,Good product,Decent product but leaves a residue behind sometimes
8,5.0,"Works , get it!","Arrived quickly, works just as listed"
9,3.0,Does the job,It does pickup the dirt in the crevaces
0,5.0,Cleans very good-wonderful product.,Cleans very good-wonderful product.
1,3.0,Okay product,This product doesn’t really get the dust in the deep corners of the car. It does get the main areas like vents and cup holders. But the main reason I bought this product was to get the hard parts of my vehicle that I couldn’t get with a rag. It is okay!
2,4.0,Good Product,Works like a champ
3,3.0,Not really worth it for the money.,Have been using a California Duster for years & with that & just a damp cloth & a little Super Clean I get results that are just as good.
4,2.0,Very limited use,
5,5.0,Amazing Productt,I didn't think this product would work at all!  But I was totally amazed!  I have grandkids that drop crumbs everywhere.  This product picked up not only dust but also crumbs from crevices of my seat.  I will be making this a stocking stuffer for holidays!
6,4.0,Surface cleaner,It does not clean crevices like they show but it does a good job on surfaces areas
7,5.0,You know how sticky it gets,I was skeptical of this because I wasn’t sure if it was like the putty that the kids make and play with and I was afraid it was going to leave residue or pieces all over the place but it has been probably one of the best purchases I’ve ever bought from Amazon it deep cleans it picks up everything beard hair crumbs pieces of candy it’s just like a blob that doesn’t stop cleaning and everyone that sees it and uses it in my car it’s so impressed by 1000% recommend
8,4.0,picks up dirt without damaging equipment.,"i used it to reach into vents and tight corners.  does not flow, you have to push it in, but it works where otherwise you would need a boxful of q-tips..."
9,5.0,Works great,It's great.  Works as advertised.  Bought more to keep on-hand.
0,5.0,Amazing,I didn't expect this to work as well as it does!
1,5.0,Great product,"This is a great product. . . .you'll not regret the purchase.  I do have one question. . .and I would like the Owner to respond, please.  The question is:  Once you get some real dirt and grime on the material, how do you remove it??  I have used mine multiple times and, well, it shows it.  Now, how do I remove the dirt from the material??"
2,2.0,Dangerous with my keyboards,"I have two gaming rgb keyboards - one desktop keyboard and another a laptop - that I used this on after seeing another reviewer with before and after pictures.  I wanted those results!I used this blob on each while they were off and pressed down a bit deeper on my desktop keyboard to get the dust lower on the keys.  It did a good job grabbing what it could reach and it looked a lot better.  However, when I turned on my computer and the normal sign-in screen popped up, characters (hidden of course since it's a password) filled the password space.  I realized that pressing this blob on the keys caused one or some of them to be stuck.  At this point, I tried to do whatever I could to fix it, but that's after trying to figure out which key(s) were stuck.  Remember that it's a password field that shows up as stars and no unhide option.  It took a while and some prayers, but it seems to be ok now.Then I checked my laptop and the same thing happened, but the fix was not as bad since I went through it just before and the keys weren't as deeply pressed with this blob.If you use this on your keyboard, be careful pressing the keys too much to get into the crevices.  Maybe have to roll it into a thin noodle like shape to get in between.I will probably use this only on the car dash away from any buttons, but then what's the difference with using a wet cloth?One other thing is that after using it, it seemed less sticky because of the dust it collected."
3,5.0,Great,Works perfectly for hard to reach spots
4,5.0,Weird stuff but it does work.,"My wife discovered the product and convinced me to purchase it. As I said, weird stuff but works well.  We used it to clean the nooks and crannied around the dash board of our cars and it worked wonders. I opened the jar and cut the amount I needed rather than using the entire contents."
5,3.0,Didn’t live up to expectations,"I didn’t have super high hopes for this but I was disappointed. I would try to pick up a visible crumb and it would take a few tries. Definitely does not go into crevices well, it seems to struggle enough on flat surfaces. Does it work? Yeah. Is is great? No."
6,5.0,Works great,Loved the ease of using this gel to clean dust from my automobile
7,3.0,Too watery.,"I purchased this product to clean the electronic equipment in my vehicles. After reading the reviews, I used rubber gloves and refrigerated the product for five days before using. The gel was still a sticky, slimy, watery goo with a mind of its own.I cannot recommend this product, there has to be something simpler, like Silly Putty. Its consistency is what I was looking for. This product is too watery to use.I would return it if I hadn't used it. Not as advertised."
8,4.0,Really does pick up dust in tight places,Easy to use and the dust and trash particles can be seen in the gel.
9,5.0,Worked like a champ to get those small crumbs out of grooves.,"I liked this product.  I was unsure at first it wouldn't get stuck and create a bigger problem then dirt in the cracks/crevices but it didn't.  A very weird feel to it, it's goo!  But it did do a great job getting the junk out where the vacation would suck small stuck things.  The directions didn't say to put it back in or throw it out so since it was pretty dirty I threw the portion I used out but a little goes a long way.  I'd recommend it."
0,3.0,Just like new,"When the crumbs are ready to go, better call for this product to get the job done."
1,4.0,Hmm. It was ok,"Didn't like the feel of it. But it just picked up big stuff, not so much dust or anything else. And you can't clean it. I dont like that, i want something similar but able to cleann, and this was not it. I tempted and ended up throwing it away."
2,3.0,Kind of a novelty item,Seems like this is more for the fun of it then really cleaning. No way of cleaning the thing after and it gets dirty and disgusting quickly.
3,3.0,"Works, but....","Works okay but you do have to be careful or, contrary to what their advertising says, it WILL leave a residue."
4,5.0,Fun to clean,Ever thought cleaning the cracks and crevices of your ride was just not a good time? Get this product and you’re in for a good time.
5,4.0,Interesting. Picks up a lot of junk you don’t see.,"I wasn’t sure it would work, but it does. Picks ups lot of junk evident by its discoloration with dirt one the first use on one car."
6,3.0,It’s ok,It’s ok. It has a really strong odor that makes your hands smell the same and it leaves a gross part slimy part something else filmy coating on your hands after handling it. I’ve only used it once so idk if either of those issues lessen with use yet. It cleaned ok. But I expected it to do a better job than it did to be honest. Maybe this isn’t a great brand and perhaps quality changes depending on the brand. I’ll give it another try but with medical gloves on first.
7,3.0,Wasn’t very sticky,It wasn’t sticky enough so it left crumbs behind
8,4.0,Works!,This does the job!  And does it well. Happy with its performance.
9,5.0,Fun time cleaning,Slime for adults that is also highly functional!
0,5.0,Práctico y excelente,"Muy fácil de usar y mantener, además deja un buen olor"
1,3.0,well..,had i known it was just slime i would have had my kid make me some lol but it does work
2,5.0,Reach those crevices!,It really drives me nuts to try to vacuum out the tiny crevices where my kids have dropped bits of who knows what.  This helped me get to where the vacuum won't reach.  Ahhh finally!  No crumbs and bits in my car!
3,3.0,Not that great,I had hoped it would work like it appeared ... Didn't remove the dust completely from the vents... And cup holders. Tossed it
4,3.0,Too runny and sticky,I bought 4 and  One of them is too runny and sticky. I had to threw it away. The other 3 came out okay.
5,5.0,Works!,Used in the car. Does a great job getting dust and crumbs out of crevices.
6,5.0,Works great,Would recommend
7,3.0,TURNED INTO STICKY SNOTS,"7/8/2022- This product worked well for the first several months, but then just yesterday, I opened it and it stuck to everything, including my hands. It looks like snots and wouldn't come off my fingers easily. Not sure what happened to make it break down like that but it may be the summer heat in the car, even though it was cool at the time I used it. I would not recommend this product."
8,4.0,Bought for a fidget,Bought this as a fidget for my daughter and she thought is was too wet feeling. After a couple weeks it started to dry up and she seemed to like it. Not sure how it works on a car.
9,5.0,Nice cleaning item for inside of vehicle,Great item to clean interior of vehicle
0,4.0,Great value fast shipping,Amazing
1,4.0,Stiffer than it appears,"This product does not flow as easily as the images make it appear.It is quite stiff, even after being warmed to body temperature.  It will get into many places, but if you want to clean things like vehicle AC vents - DON'T! - it will take a lot of force to get it in there, which may damage the plastic of the vents!  And if it'll damage that plastic, just imagine what it'll do to your infotainment screen...Be careful!But it does clean areas other things can't access quite nicely."
2,5.0,best thing since sliced bread!!!!,"throughout the years, one of the most annoying things have been those pesky keypads. This has been true with the old desktops, the laptop computers and now with the 2-in-one convertible thingys. Everything, and I mean everything gets caught in them. Beards, hair, toothpaste, and enough food to feed Napolian Bonaparte's army!!!!!""Pathetic"" doesn't begin to describe!We have tried everything! Airspray, (HA! Like those work!)Finally something that works!!!!!I recommend this for everyone! All ages can benefit from this magnificent product!"
3,4.0,Like it -sticky don’t get on upholstery,"I like this goop.  It does clean up the crevices in the car vents, etc.  It is very sticky, so you don’t want to get it on the upholstery."
4,4.0,Easy to use and great for getting into crevices!,Use for detailing interior of my car and on my keyboards.  Great stuff!
5,3.0,Works ok but not magic,This product is adequate but you have to run it over the surface a few times.  It didn't deep clean inside my driver's door pocket...it picks up loose crumbs but you really have to work at it.  No where on the package does it say how to clean it.  It just says to never get it wet.
6,2.0,Disappointing,"I bought this to clean crevices in the car console. I tried it first on my computer keyboard. It was okay, but not great. A few days later I took it out to the car. When I opened the lid n liquid fell out on my clothes and on the car seat. It had liquefied to the point of being unusable."
7,3.0,It's Just OKAY,"I used it to clean keyboard which cleaned it adequately. It was easy to use. However, it didn't deep clean like i thought it would. Ill keep looking for different product."
8,3.0,Messy,It would fall apart and leave sticky parts behind
9,5.0,Effective and easy to use!,This is simple to use and effective!
0,3.0,It’s ok,I really like the idea of this and it does get in all the hard places to reach and buttons etc. but I dropped it one time and it collected everything on the ground. It was so gross! It comes with no instructions so I’m not sure if it can get wet to be rinsed off?or how you’re supposed to clean it? And It was a bit of a weird smell to it
1,4.0,blue slime,so i used this on the truck cup holders and hard to get spots and it worked good got alot of the dirt and sand and dust out but not all.it works like it says it would but i only got 1 use out of it
2,3.0,Car cleaner,Honestly it annoys me how dirty it gets lol and it doenst pick up everything which is sad
3,5.0,The perfect buy!,Seriously cannot get enough of this thing! I use it for everything in my car from the HVAC vents to the stick shifter! It cleans every nook and crannie! It’s easy to get out of the container and easily picks up even the tiniest of crumbs from my cup holders!
4,3.0,Makes fingers feel funny....,It does work I just don't like the way it made my fingers feel after using it.
5,4.0,Great for the car,This product was the tiniest bit stiffer than I thought it would be. There were a few deeper cracks in my car interior that it couldn't reach because it held firm to its shape but it did a good job overall
6,3.0,It’s okay,"It’s okay. Gets stuck in crevices but not permanently stuck. Don’t get me wrong, it does ok. Just not a miracle cleaner by any means"
7,3.0,only lasts a few uses,i have used this 3 times and it is struggling to pick things up now
8,3.0,Excellent product,Used the product to clean up dog hair in the car and Surprise it worked. Will buy again.
9,3.0,Hard to clean after use,Used in my car to clean all the crumbs in Cup holder. Picked up the crumbs but hard to clean for reuse. Got about 3 uses out it.
0,2.0,"Messy, doesn’t get into smaller areas and sticks to hands",I used it within a few weeks of receiving it and it it was very oozy. It was hard to control and tried to drip out of my hands which also made it difficult to move around to different spots. It didn’t get into smaller crevices so I was better off a toothpick. For more exposed areas I did better with a paper towel and cleaning agent.  It stuck very well to my hands which took awhile to get off but I don’t need this to clean my hands. Soap and water are meant for that. Not very useful at all
1,5.0,Perfecto para recoger El polvo,Fácil de usar
2,4.0,Grabs DUST,"Weird stuff, haven't tried it on the car yet (too d#% cold), but it seems to work good at removing DUST (not grime) from computer cooling grills and speakers. It did a great job cleaning up RC transmitter.  To be clear, it grabs dust, it won't clean the grime from your keyboard.  It doesn't seem to leave any residue."
3,4.0,Works okay,Don’t use it on a very warm car. It will leave residue. Other than that it works okay.
4,3.0,Not Strong Enough,Not Strong Enough to clean everything.That works with cup holder and some dust.
5,5.0,Cool,"It does what the advertisement says it will do. Buy several of them though. If you work out of your car like I do, it gets too dirty to use fast."
6,3.0,Not up to expectations,Not up to my expectations
7,5.0,easy to use,I tried it once so far and worked good. Pretty cool. Nice for  a quick clean up @ dash and console area. Left a little residue @ gear shift but wiped clean easy. Great idea for a quick clean up of car. will try again!!
8,4.0,This is just slime,Save yourself the cost and buy it make some slime like the stuff your children play with. I tried to get to the dust and pet hair that had accumulated in my car. Minimal pick up of that which I had assumed would be easy. When used on the metal mesh cover on speakers it came away with what looked like years of nicotine and I don't smoke nor have I ever permitted smoking in my vehicle so this was something that surprised me but not unexpected as the magnets in the speaker will attract any tiny airborne magnetic materials. Unfortunately this product did not work as I had expected so I cannot give a 5 ⭐ rating. Works on the dirt you can't see in vents and mesh but not in all the bigger stuff
9,3.0,It’s….ok I guess.,It did work ok to get some of the surface dust and particles off my center console but really didn’t work as I’d hoped for getting into the crevices between the different components and dials. So for the $6 I paid I’m neither happy or unhappy.
0,4.0,Better than a vacuum,Works great for getting into all the hard to reach places. My car is dust free ( for a little while). Great product!
1,5.0,Gets the hard to reach cracks,Works great. Easy to use
2,2.0,Not sure what happened...,"I initially bought it and it was amazing at cleaning my car! Took all the dust out of the hard to get places and my car looked great. Did it to both of our cars. Fast forward to less than 3 months later and I'm ready to use it again, it turned into a liquid mess. Nothing like it was when I first got it and it's just been sitting on the shelf in my house. I have no idea what happened but I threw it away immediately. I would say it worked great at the beginning but it's kind of a one time use."
3,5.0,My keyboard has never been cleaner!,"I was skeptical at first! But let me tell you I am so happy that I purchased this. I work from home have three computer monitors a keyboard, printer etc that gathers dust like nobody's business. I popped this open and was able to attract all of the dust and dirt out of my keyboard like nothing! picked up all the little things inside the keys!! If you're wondering if it's worth a shot it's definitely worth a shot!"
4,3.0,Why do I have to write a review?,"Shouldn't the Stars suffice? Here, I will reiterate what I've illustrated with stars. It really didn't pick up that much stuff. It was easy to use and easily removed from surfaces which is probably why I didn't pick anything up."
5,5.0,Product works as advertised!,Cleaning inside interior and dash. Excellent product
6,4.0,Fun and quick to remove dust and dirt in small places,"If you want to get the kids/grandkids involved in detailing your car, this will help!  While I’d say it works at about 90%, it is fun to use. I find that I had to apply more pressure than I expected. Some really tiny crevices took extra work and I needed to use a toothpick and scrub brush (denture brush works really well) to loosen some of the dust/dirt that had been there for a while. It’s been a while since we detailed the car, and this did make the task easier and we got better results than if we hadn’t used it.  I can’t speak as to how long this will work, but as of the first use, I liked it, and I’ll be using it again in the house on our electronics."
7,5.0,Great to clean up quickly!,My husband got a different brant and it was a MESS! It was sticky and gross! Mine has never been this way and works great!
8,5.0,easy to use,Easy to use for cleaning up the car. I live in florida with sand EVERYWHERE and this is great for helping get sand out of weird hard to reach places of the car that a vacuum doesn't reach.
9,5.0,Cleanet,Everything
0,2.0,Not worth the money,"I had high hopes for this as the reviews were great.  I used it to clean the vents and cup holders in my car.  Firstly it was VERY slippery and I almost dropped it many times.  It did pick up the dust, but it also left a residue on the car and when it dried I found little bluish dried pieces all over the car.  A bit of a disappointment.  I obviously can't return it b'c I used it, but if I could return it I would."
1,5.0,it does what was promised,na
2,5.0,I’ve used this multiple times,"I keep this in my car, so while I’m waiting in a drive thru or something I pull it out and clean my dash, the center console, it gets into all the nooks and crannies. Play with it a bit to get it ‘fluffy’ once you remove from the canister. Then push it into the crevices. Works well for me!"
3,5.0,It Works,This product just works!
4,3.0,not worth the hype,Tried to use in some hard to reach spots in the car.  It didn't pick up any more than what I was able to get with a soft toothbrush.  I drank the kool-ade and would not purchase again.
5,5.0,Why didn't I get this sooner??,"The cleaning get for your car is a product no only for your car, but for anything that has small crevices or cracks that need to be cleaned.  It leaves no residue and is easily removed and stored in its container, ready for it's next use.  I will be buying more and keeping it around the house and in the car!"
6,5.0,Many uses,"I use this for cleaning the freezer, car, hard to reach spots in door ways and corners"
7,3.0,Disappointed,Product did not live up to expectations that were described on the Amazon site.
8,5.0,Works great,Already recommended to family and friends
9,5.0,I was skeptical 🧐!,"I bought this product mostly as curiosity to try it out, not with a full expectation, but it surprised me how good it worked while I was cleaning the car in specially in small and difficult areas and it cleaned it 👍🏻 great. Yes! I recommend it."
0,5.0,This stuff is amazing!,"When I chose this item I didn't know exactly what it was or what is did. But my car cup holder was disgusting with spilled coffee, chocolate milk, and yes crumbs of cookies, crackers, and other unidentifiable crumbs. So when it arrived I tried it right away. It feels so weird- not like playdough but closer to Gloop. I pinched out a handful of the stuff and began cleaning. It was so good at picking up all that crap!  Slowly the handful of goop became gray with the dirt. Soon I was actually looking for more things to clean and you can't get any better than that."
1,5.0,worked well for me,"i think it does what it is advertised to do, i rolled it around the dash, cupholders, console etc all the hard to reach areas (air vents)  it picked up very well.  i would purchase another when this turns black.  keep in mind, it isnt a vacuum or a rag, dont expect it to pick up like a rainbow vacuum system"
2,5.0,CLEANING GEL,I gave these out in Christmas stocking stuffers
3,4.0,Worth the small investment.,"For the price this works great for picking up lint, small pieces of trash.  Doesn't pick up the dust on dashboards etc.  But I do like it"
4,4.0,Great but avoid heat!,This was super great for cleaning little cracks and vents but definitely don’t leave it in the car or garage because it gets super melty and sticky and will be ruined if it gets too hot!
5,2.0,I won't buy this again,"The price on this product was a reflection of what I got. I didnt expect for everything to be squeaky clean but I had to go back over stuff to make it cleaner. I used it in the car vents but it was more helpful getting crumbs out of the arm console (it slipped out of my hand) and the car mat. Despite bring a weird yet interesting texture it was easy to use. However, if you don't keep a firm grip it will separate from the bigger piece but super easy to mesh back together. To bad it's not made for kids. It's like that slime they make but smoother. Try it for yourself, you may have better results with what you are cleaning."
6,4.0,effective but smells bad,Cleans dust easily in hard to reach places or easily smudged items. The only thing I don't like is the smell. After handling this stuff your hands smell like chemicals.
7,5.0,works as promised,Cleaned as promised and is easy to store in the car.
8,5.0,You'll always want some around!,Much more efficient than a hand vac!
9,5.0,Great product,This stuff is amazing! Very easy to use and works great
0,3.0,Just okay,Expected this to pick up more dust
1,3.0,Fine,Ok
2,5.0,Just what I needed,This was just what I needed to get the little pieces of stuff in between my gear shaft.
3,5.0,Cleaner really works better,This cleaner works a lot easier and better than vacuuming and/or moist cloths.
4,5.0,Best item since sliced bread!,"This item is not only great for getting into the nooks and crannies to clean cars or electronicdevices but is also good for cleaning window tracks, corners around door jams and hard to getto seams of refrigerators, and those left over crumbs you can’t seem reach after you havecleaned your toaster and toaster oven.  So many uses to list.  Great item!"
5,5.0,Great Invention!!,"This ""goo"" gets into the deepest spots in my car; I even used it under my car seat and on the rug between the door and the car seats where my vacuum-cleaner was too wide to reach.  I love this stuff and will re-order it over and over.  I also use it in my silverware drawer to get all the crumbs.  I highly recommend it."
6,3.0,Dose not clean as good as advertised,"it is no so sticky and dose not clean and in the advertisement. work ok, but just ok"
7,5.0,Product works as described for car cleaning.,"Ease of use to assist in cleaning of car, particularly nooks and crannies."
8,3.0,Didn't work as well as expected,"The goo was easy to use and didn't leave a residue, but it didn't pick up the small particles from the crevices as well as I was hoping or expecting."
9,3.0,Store in the fridge,This gel cleans wonderfully.Don't let it linger in the car longer than an hour; it will turn the gel to goo.
0,5.0,all good,100%
1,5.0,Where has this stuff been all my life?,This goop makes cleaning things with crevices sooo easy. I keep one for my keyboard and electronics and one in my car. This is for anybody who has spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to scrape stuff out of the cracks of something valuable and ended up failing to clean and/or damaging your car/phone/keyboard/etc.
2,3.0,not what I expected,not as good as I thought it would be on the dog hairs in the corners.  Probably my misinterpretation of what the product really is meant for.
3,3.0,Not worth the money,"The car slime is alright. It gets some of the tiny things that are hard to get to normally, but considering you can make it at home is just not worth the money. They get gross quickly with no way to clean them and don't do a whole lot."
4,5.0,Exactly what I wanted,Did just what I have seen on youtube.
5,4.0,Works ok… I’ve had other (I can’t remember the brand) and they worked much better.,"Works ok for the price, others on the market work much netter tho. Also, I left it in my glove box on Ohio on a cold day and it froze completely sand we had to throw it away"
6,5.0,The product I was looking,"Very easy to use,cleans the difficult vents, easy to remove, nonstickyExcellent product 👌 👏 👍"
7,5.0,NICE!!!!!!!,Best product for cleaning keyboards and car interiors
8,5.0,Amazing Product,"This cleaning car gel is awesome.Pleasant smell. Not too sticky in your hand, which I expected.  It gets into every nook and cranny in the car without leaving any residue.  I pick out crumbs from the gel if they are big. I've had it for a while and it still is not sticky and works.  As in the instructions, you just knead the gel, to get into snall places.  It is still clean (blue) and fits back into the container, which I keep in my car. There are spaces in the car, the the Car Wash facilities never clean.  This gel is perfect for small spaces. 👍"
9,5.0,Perfect one time use,Made my car dashboard really clean
0,5.0,Works great for car interior,"Works great for car interior dust, crumbs and dog hair removal!"
1,2.0,Didn’t work well,
2,4.0,Not great,I thought this would be good for those tinny cracks and crevices my vacuum couldn't get to but it left a slimy liquid residue.
3,5.0,Must Have Product For Car Interior,This product does help picking up loose dirt or hair from dashboards air vents even on leather seats and steering wheels. Must have. Although it will not make car completely dirt free but it will help eliminate about 80% of mess inside your vehicle.
4,3.0,It's ok.,It seems to stick mostly ro my hand. It's like goo. Not a good purchase
5,5.0,Pretty cool,Nice
6,5.0,Just what I needed to keep my car console clean.,"This product works like magic. I’ve vacuumed and used air hose on my car console and they never get it like I want it. I ordered this product and I was amazed! I rolled it around and it got EVERY bit of dust and misc things, every bit. I took 4 minutes to do my whole giant console area.Highly recommend.I’m ordering one for my husband and my grown children."
7,5.0,Love this stuff!,"I live on a gravel road in the country so my car inevitably gets covered in dust, inside and out. I have bought this stuff multiple times. It's the easiest way to get into all the cracks and crevices in my car to actually get the dust and dirt out. One container pretty much cleans the entire inside of my car one time (like seats, vents, doors, everything except the floors). I throw it away after I clean the whole inside of my car, but if you only used it here and there it would last much longer."
8,3.0,Eh,Doesn’t work as well as I’d hoped.
9,5.0,Picked up the crumbs and dust,Is cleaned up the dust and stuff.  Dabbed it and it didn’t stick to the dash.
0,3.0,Not worth the money,"So I used this a few times as a last ditch effort to get rid of toddler crumbs. Honestly, I just got my car detailed and I could have saved the money from this puddy and put it towards actually vacuuming the crumbs out instead. Good idea but not really worth the money."
1,4.0,Works just like they advertise,"I own a jeep. I take the top off every summer. As you can imagine, dust finds its way into every nook and crazy of my jeep. I initially set out to see how good it works and was going to spend 10 minutes checking it out in my jeep. I spent an hour and used it every where I could get it into and my jeep looks brand new on the inside. This stuff works great."
2,5.0,Awesome product,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews because this thing works great. The one thing that always drives me crazy is the crumbs, dirt, etc that gets in car crevices that I can only get up by vacuuming…until I found this product. I haven’t tried it anywhere else and want to keep this available in my car but plan on purchasing another one to keep in the house."
3,5.0,Works!,Easy-to-use and works well!
4,3.0,"Easy2use, gabs surface dust n dirt. Not sticky. Need2press so dirt stays in. Not for deep cleaning.",It's okey.  Easy tool for cleaning car.
5,5.0,easy to use ....doesa good job of cleaning,Cleans well....easy to remove
6,3.0,Meh,Great concept although it needs improvement for deep cleaning. Works great on dust and minor clean up.
7,3.0,Gets sticky after awhile,Gets sticky after using it so many times.
8,3.0,Not as effective as I hoped for,I didn't have to use the whole jar to clean the inside of the car which was nice.  But it just didn't pick up as much debris as I thought it would. I guess I was looking for a miracle
9,4.0,Picks up well in creases and tight little spaces,Works pretty good in small creases and spaces you usually cant vacuum.  I haven't gotten the chance to see how long it last yet but hopefully a good while.
0,5.0,Gets into those hard to reach spots and grabs the gunk and dust,Just received and cleaned my keyboard.  Took a small piece and clean car.  Amazing and fun.
1,5.0,Works as expected,Product works!
2,4.0,Slime on fingers after use,"You can cut it into pieces and use it in small areas. The color will clearly show the dirt that is picked up.  After you use it, your hands will have some slime-like feel. I think I'll use gloves next time.  I had to dock 1 star for this product because the description could say that it's slime on your hands when using or recommend gloves."
3,4.0,This is a neat product.,That first time you feel this gel when you take it out of the jar is a very strange feeling.  Cool and clammy feeling but the product works well.
4,5.0,Works well,"This stuff is great. I keep it in the cas so as I am going through a car wash, waiting in line, etc.. I clean the inside of the car."
5,5.0,Lifesaver,"This stuff is amazing. It has saved my ass from everything from cigarette ashes, to gravel, to fingernail clippings, to errant Taco Bell cheese caked in my car seats. It's also washable to remove some gunk and get a fresh start once it starts to get too full of stuff! I use it about once a week to get in my vents, seats, any flat surface w dust, and screens too. Perfect alien blob."
6,5.0,Cleans hard to get small dirt and dust,Used it to get hard to get dirt and dust in crevices in my car and electronics like keyboard. Works great!
7,5.0,Great product,Zk high gym jg nfbmv me kg job gmcjt oh my nf
8,2.0,Couldn't Reuse It,"I expected to get multiple car console cleanings out of it. But there were lots of chunky items that got picked up and then had no place to go.  I thought it would somehow absorb stuff, but it didn't. So I ended up with this gooey, chunky mess that I had to throw out."
9,5.0,Surprisingly useful,"I was dubious about the product but it was one of Amazon's daily deals so the price was right. I am amazed at how well this gel/goop worked. Just a small pinch was enough to do a great job of cleaning up all the small grooves and gaps in the knobs, switches and buttons in the center console of my CR-V. I just kept rubbing it around and it kept picking stuff up. It leaves a bit of a sheen behind so it is definitely depositing something on the surfaces as you work it in. Not sure if it's oil or liquid silicone or what. It's only been a couple of days so I can't say if it causes dust or dirt to stick, which would defeat the purpose of the product. So far, so good.If I find any definite drawbacks I'll update this review. As for now this stuff gets a strong 5 stars."
0,2.0,Waste of my money,Honestly a waste of money in my opinion. I feel like I’m doing nothing when I’m sticking it to my vents. Could have gone without the purchase
1,5.0,Great Product,Does a good job cleaning the vents and all those little spots.
2,2.0,Not so great,i had to use it several times in one area just for it grab.  Does not work great on vents as shown.  On the plus it does not leave a residue behind
3,3.0,Cannot clean it. Short use cycle,Worked once for cleaning. Then dirt embedded and ccannit clean
4,5.0,It REALLY works,
5,5.0,Works well,Love this stuff! It works so well for getting everything out of all the cracks and crevices.
6,5.0,Perfect for cleaning dust,I love it cleans well grabs the smallest little dust
7,5.0,Little weird but works good,So far it’s cleaned most of everything we threw at it. Few items that where stuck in seems good it wouldn’t pull out. Will be curious how long this stuff lasts before too much material sticks in it.
8,3.0,I wouldnt buy again,It does work but its sort of messy.
9,4.0,this product is ok,I'm not really like it
0,4.0,Es bueno,"es bueno, le he dado varios usos y todavía sirve. Recomendado"
1,2.0,Pretty much slime.,This stuff isn't sticky enough to really pull away debris. I don't see it doing anything that a wipe couldn't do.
2,5.0,Looooove it!,Works great. It reaches all those places you can’t reach and gets the dirt and the junk out
3,5.0,Get all in the nooks and crannies,"Has a scent. Not unpleasant to me, might be strong for the scent-sensitive at first. It does pretty well at sliding into vents and creases. Shines things up a bit, too. Very handy. Would be great for maintenance level cleaning! Will buy again!"
4,5.0,Easy to use great product!!,"We love this for all the dusty, black areas on our SUV dash.  We have given the product to friends.  It is great."
5,3.0,Doesn't work as expected.,"It was very easy to use, but didn't remove as much dirt/dust as I thought it would."
6,5.0,Nifty little Cleaner,Pretty cool little cleaner and fun to use.  Cleaned the vents on my car easily and completely.
7,5.0,"Clean car, computer phones","Works well on cleaning phones, cars, computers. Will buy extra one to keep in car."
8,3.0,Does a good job,Works fantastic
9,3.0,Not meant for the fl weather,Not for the florida weather. the product melted in my car after one day of usage.
0,3.0,Works pretty well,It got a lot of stuff but not everything.  I had to go behind with a toothbrush and rag.  To be fair it had been a while since I cleaned the car out.  If you are just getting dust it would be fine.
1,5.0,Works well,I'm still a little leary of something that just holds the dirt and doesn't need cleaned after each use but we'll see how long it lasts. It cleaned up the shift and vents really good on the first use. I've only used it once so I'll update if it doesn't work well after.
2,5.0,The best stuff ever!,"Seriously. I love this stuff. I never write reviews, but I love this. It works well. It isn't too sticky. I would buy it again. Plus it is kind of fun to play with."
3,5.0,Magic product.,"I was a Skeptic that this would work, but it does. I keep it in my car for the cup holders esp."
4,3.0,It’s just like kids slime,This is for surface level dust/crumb pick up- not a cleaner. Looks and feels just like slime.
5,3.0,So-so,Easy to remove debris in my car but only after  repeatedly applying
6,5.0,Does the job,It’s amazing at getting all the small dust in small to reach areas and easy to use
7,5.0,Great cleaner with no residue.,This cleaner is so convenient in the jar.  Easy to roll or blot over areas needing cleaning and leaves no residue on the surface.
8,5.0,quite handy,works as it says it does. so handy and easy to use
9,3.0,Didn’t get as much dirt as I expected,It left bits of blue slime and didn’t work on small specs
0,2.0,Don't leave in car,Used the product once and liked it.  Stored it in my car for convenience. Went to use it a second time and it was all wet and gooey. Could not use it again because it would leave a slime all over my hands and the car. The gel and car were both cool when trying to use a second time. Do not leave product in hot car I guess.
1,3.0,It was ok,It really did not clean as well as I thought it would. Left a lot behind.
2,4.0,It’s good,It’s good but it has a hard time picking up small dust from vents. It gets most of it but also leaves some behind. But I was excited to try and glad I bought it. I will be buying again
3,5.0,Best thing ever,At first I was skeptical because there’s no way one that it would clean my car and two go back into the container that I received it in. Well I was wrong both times! Not only did it clean the hard spaces that I’ve been trying to get for awhile it did fit perfectly back into the container. I bought it more so for the center console and let’s say I’m pleased! Best purchase I’ve made in April!
4,5.0,Cleaning gel,Works great in the hard to get cracks
5,5.0,EASY,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!!
6,4.0,Vary good product,Easy to use.  Truck and car interiors
7,3.0,Just ok,Just ok
8,3.0,Something different then a micro fiber. Would recommend,I liked that its reusable and that it gets into tight area like vents and keypords
9,5.0,A Working Product,All that needs to be said is that this slimy product actually works quite well.
0,2.0,It didn't work well,"Not worth it!  Saw a video and I thought wow,  because I have a dog that sheds so much.  It worked fine the first time, but that's about it.  I won't buy it again."
1,3.0,Doesn't last long at all,Works great until it gets dirty then you might as well toss it and buy another.
2,4.0,easy to use,I thought it was great to finally get my car console clean with so little effort. Works great!
3,5.0,Functionality,Everything good
4,2.0,Not the best,I was so excited to try this in my dusty car and let's face it as an adult we get to play with slime for cleaning how fun. I won't say it didn't work on the surface but it defiantly was to thick to get those hard to reach vents I smashed it in and pulled it out it's not like the picture when it forms to the vent I even left it sit in the sun to see if it would melt its way deeper into the vents and it didn't but its easy to pull out nothing got stuck in the vent slots
5,4.0,Different cleanser,Different cleanserSlimey
6,3.0,Gel,Ok
7,5.0,Buy IT!,fun and easy tp you
8,5.0,Satisfying Slime Clean,I really enjoy the cleaning gel. It has a sensory play feel to it. Gets all the dust a grim out of the hard to reach crevices. Works better if you let it sit. It will get stuck in your clothes. It’s very satisfying.
9,3.0,Ok not too bad and not the best,Was ok
0,3.0,No better than a microfiber rag,I like it for around the gear shift but it's not any better than a microfiber rag.
1,4.0,Good for hard to get spots,Pretty basic but it does a decent job
2,5.0,Works well,"Smells pretty good, works well"
3,3.0,Dime de limpieza,Está bien por el precio.
4,5.0,Car slime!,Very easy to use.
5,4.0,Si se puede comprar,Si se puede comprar. Es como todo tienes q dejar q se pegue bien para q coja lo sucio
6,4.0,"Gel works well. Each jar is pretty small. Needed two to clean car vents, 3 for sliding screen door.",All was good.
7,3.0,It's ok,It's ok but I was hoping it work better
8,3.0,Maybe I am not using it correctly??,"I was excited to use this stuff, but it seems like its not really grabbing anything I'll post a video soon."
9,3.0,Didn’t Do Much,"I finally broke and ordered this after seeing it on Tiktok so much… honestly didn’t really see a huge change using it. Car wipes in my opinion are still the easiest and most efficient way of getting dust, dirt and pollen out."
0,4.0,So sticky work's well,Works well on vents and cup holders.
1,5.0,Neat way to remove dust,This is a great idea to get rid of dust that seems to always be on the dash in my car. It really was easy to use and it left a nice lite smell. I can keep it in its container in the door of my car to use whenever the mood hits.
2,4.0,Pretty Good,"Not as sticky as I hoped, but does a pretty decent job."
3,5.0,HOORAH for Cleaning Gel!,"I am so pleased to have purchased this cleaning gel! It is very easy to use. It easily picked up the visible dust and debris from the car vents, small compartments, and trays. So, I used it in areas that are hard to reach and see, too. More clean!I have given away a couple of these and will be ordering more to keep and share."
4,3.0,Cleaning gel,I don’t see any difference when I use it.
5,5.0,so weird and really works,"Ok I bought this on a lark, not expecting it to work all that well,  but it really works great in crevices in the car!  It feels weird and looks weird, but it is kind of fun and like being a kid again to use it.  I do recommend it!"
6,5.0,Works great in hard to clean places,I was skeptical about this stuff but it really works on those hard to get places. I used it on the air vents and center console of my Chevy Traverse. It worked great!
7,3.0,Melts easy and hard to remove,If the temperature is hot out or even warm it’s hard for the gel to actually pick up anything. This actually kept breaking apart. Wouldn’t recommend. I’ll be trying something else next time.
8,5.0,I'm happy with results,I am happy with results for cleaning between keys on keyboards (still need canned air for deep cleaning) and various small grooves / vents in car. My tip - roll it back and forth if possible (don't smear it). Don't leave it sitting on surface - just put on surface a few seconds.
9,5.0,Magic!!!!,This stuff is simply magical!!! It worked amazing!! I used a tiny chunk and it did my whole Jeep Compass very happy with this purchase!
0,4.0,Worked well!,"Many years of detailing, and I never tried that.  Works well,good price, fast ship!"
1,2.0,Not that good on keyboards,"The PULIOIKI cleaning gel works okay on surface dust, but I had trouble forcing it down far enough to do a good job of cleaning a keyboard.  When I did get it down farther, I worried that some of it would stick under the keys.  This did not happen, but I think I will just use a soft brush and a vacuum to clean my keyboard.  I clean the top surfaces with a damp cloth, so I don't need this gel for cleaning surface dust.  I may try it on some narrow spots in my car's dash but again, a brush and vacuum will likely do better."
2,4.0,Easy to use.,It’s easy to use. I used for cleaning car dashboard and keyboards.
3,4.0,Cleans well but slimy,"After using this, I think you can use any slime putty. I bought plastic gloves to wear when I use this slime because it does leave residue and scent on your hands. The residue does wash off easily."
4,5.0,Great for hard to reach cracks etc,"All those areas in the car or in your tech that you just cannot get to with brushes or the vacuum this will do the trick. Buttons, depressions, cracks, crevasse', leather foreskin around the emergency brake and shift lever all clean up nicely with this product. It was even easy to clean the back deck area behind the rear seats in the car that is hard to get to in my car.Now that I have it, I wont be without it.Its really just conveniently made and prepackaged slime like the kids play with and you could make your own for less if you care to mess with it.But try some either way, its a great product for cleaning hard to reach areas in the home or car."
5,5.0,Can't believe the crud it picked up.,This product is easy to use and does a great job removing all the little pieces of dirt and crumbs - as well as dust.  Didn't realize how dusty my car was until I used it.  I will buy it again when the current one needs to be replaced.
6,4.0,It’s okay,It is not all that. But it gets rid of dust. I wish it could’ve reached
7,3.0,Ok,It removed dust but that was about it
8,5.0,Almost but not quite,Didn’t really remove all specks as I had hoped
9,5.0,It is a simple step,This is such a nice easy simple step that you can do while you’re waiting at a red light .Just clean up all that little debris that flies in through the windows etc. etc. on your dashboard and near your gearshift and then you put it back in its little barrel
0,5.0,Good stuff,"I was super skeptical and thought this stuff was gimmicky but, it's not. I've found many uses for example, I used it to clean crumbs out of my kitchen drawers and it worked great. I am going to purchase additional for house, 5th wheel and our boat. This is good stuff!"
1,5.0,Outstanding Delivery,"Too soon to comment on the product but my first trial seems to equal or surpass other available cleaning aids. However, the delivery was outstanding. My shipment was received earlier than expected. Thank you very much."
2,5.0,Works great!,"I love this stuff! cleaned my whole keyboard super quick. Works great getting dust out of the vents, cupholders, etc. in the car. I am a big fan. Plus its kind of fun :)"
3,4.0,buen producto,lo único que no me gustó es que se seca muy rápido una vez está fuera del envase
4,5.0,It works!,This gooey stuff actually works. I like how I can get into the seams in my car’s upholstery to get dust out. Also works in vents to get dust and dirt out. I’ve used it it quite a bit and it’s still working. I leave it in the car and use it when I’m waiting somewhere. It’s not too sticky and it does come off of surfaces easily. I recommend it!
5,5.0,GREAT PRODUCT,LOVE IT!!!!!!
6,5.0,Excellent for getting dust and hair up in my vehicle,Love this product. Very easy to use and very effective.
7,5.0,Does exactly what it says!,"I love this! It’s genius. It was easy to use, clean, and store. I have it stored in my car for quick cleanups of pollen, ash, dust...the lost fry in the crevasse of the seat. It also smells good (lol) and  is really satisfying to squish like a stress ball. Multi purpose!"
8,5.0,EXCELLENT PRODUCT! WILL BUY AGAIN!,I used this to clean all over my house. Worked great in window crevices! Also on the track the sliding door sits in. Anyplace a rag or vacuum can’t get in
9,3.0,"Ok, but not great",So-so
0,5.0,Life changing,Where have you been all my life makes getting those hard to reach places a breeze.
1,3.0,"Not sure how to feel - not reusable, probably better off w canned air and a microfiber rag","Not sure how to feel, was really excited thinking it would be something easy to use for the nooks and crannies and then rinse and dry and repeat but it says not to do that so all the crumbs just....stick. To the gel. Then it's...disgusting. So. Great gimmicky stocking stuffer for 1x use but not a real cleaning tool to stock yourself up on."
2,3.0,Does a decent job,"This product is great if you have a bunch of crumbs, dust, etc. just sitting on your dash or seats. If you are expecting this to get stuff in deep cracks or even shallow ones, it will not do the job."
3,5.0,It really works!,Picks up particles in the crevices and can be rinsed off to be ready for the next cleaning job.
4,3.0,Okay,When I first got I thought it was pretty cool. It picked up some dust and what not in my car. I tried it on my keyboard at work the other day. It did not work like showed in ad  I had it on my keyboard over night it did not spread out from what I put it  So it did not clean around the keys at all  I don’t think I would recommend this product to any one.
5,5.0,Best cleaning gel I've ever used.,Works very well. Removes all the junk that accumulates in small crevice.
6,4.0,Happy,Happy with product
7,5.0,Miracle Product,"I put this on the console of my car. My car is older and getting into the crevices to clean is hard. I put the product in my cosole and it looks BRAND NEW. Like, I just left the car dealershio new. I need to buy another obe because it picked up so much debris, it is filled up. But I looovvvee this product."
8,4.0,Not good with dog hair,"I bought this specifically for the dog hair in my car… Didn’t really pick up too much, but does come in handy so I’m not completely mad"
9,5.0,Works wonderful!,Works great for the dust in vents and the little crease by the shifter. Got the little bits you can't wipe away with a rag. I absolutely love it.
0,4.0,Bien,Es normal
1,5.0,Perfect for cat hair,My cat likes to invade my desk and his hair can get in the keyboard but this product remove me it and dust great!
2,4.0,It does a decent job,Speeds up the detail process
3,3.0,It’s ok,I like it but I don’t think it’s works as great as I was expecting. I guess you get what you paid for.
4,5.0,Worth it,Weird stuff but it picks up sorry from tight spots
5,5.0,Easy to use and works well!,Cleaning crumbs from hard to get to places in my car and furniture!  Great product…love it!
6,5.0,Diamond level Detail,"This is great little tool.  The only down side if there is one, it that it works too well.  If your car is very dirty this product becomes very dirty very quickly.  But that is what its designed for.  Highly recommend it but you might want to buy two.  One to clean up with and one to keep in the glove box to tidy up with day to day!  Outstanding idea."
7,3.0,Great concept/Shaky execution,It doesn’t mold to the vents the way it shows and it’s only good for maybe three uses. Not for deep cleaning but it’ll collect dust in a pinch. I’m sure there’s better products out there but for the price it wasn’t bad.
8,3.0,Durability,"It worked, but had to keep rinsing it after every vent"
9,5.0,Works great,Amazing product.
0,5.0,Gooey Clean,I carry this in my car and I like to use it in places difficult to reach like the gear shift or across my dash board. It’s a nice little help in a hurry or for detailing.
1,2.0,Didn’t pick anything up really….,It didn’t really work…I don’t know why?
2,2.0,Not very effective,"Picks up dust, but does not pick up larger particles very well."
3,4.0,Good,Good
4,4.0,Works,"Seems to work well,"
5,5.0,Cleaning is easier,"I did not dislike the product, but it's very good at cleaning.  I did not try the deep clean yet.  I supposed it would be great!  I gave this product 5 stars."
6,3.0,Hay más o menos,No limpia como dice
7,5.0,It's Amazing!!!!!!,I love that it did what it said it would do: clean the interior of my car without using sprays or wet wipes!
8,5.0,Muy buena compra todo llegó como lo publicitan,"Buen producto, cumple todo lo que ofrece."
9,4.0,It works,It works great in the cup holder and vents.
0,2.0,Doesn’t flow,"This product doesn’t perform as advertised. It doesn’t ‘flow’ into cracks and crannies. It just sits on a surface slowly spreading out but not down into small places. It didn’t clean a keyboard at all. I tried it on my oven handle where crumbs build up where it attaches to the door. I even tried to push it into the space, but it wouldn’t go. It will pick up if you pull it on crumbs on a flat surface, but that’s what brooms are for. I bought it for my hubby’s grubby computer and did not flow into a single impression. It is, however, fun to play with if you want to make funny sounds!"
1,5.0,How to clean the gel,It didn’t come with any instructions for cleaning the gel when it gets dirty.
2,5.0,A+,"I really like it! No residue is left, and it doesn't get stuck. I'm really happy with it, and highly recommend to all."
3,4.0,Better than expected,Did a pretty nice job in my car
4,5.0,Slimy,Works for the price
5,2.0,Took off a little bit of dust (one layer) but not all of it,Took off a little bit of dust (one layer) but not all of it
6,4.0,Good so far,Looks like a great product..i will see how much use i will get out of it
7,5.0,Best thing I have bought to clean EVER,"This stufg is amazing I originally got if for my car but wow did it work anywhere. Used it in thr car and it left those yucky crummy cracks spotless. Inside I used it on my fans, vents stove grate and so on. Its an awesome product u will not regret this purchase!"
8,4.0,It works,"I loved this when it was a couple months old but hot weather came and it stuck to my hands and car !!!!I guess it needs to be kept in a cool place !!!I ordered another one anyway because they do work, I could have over used my first one !"
9,3.0,Got the dust out of AC vents better than q-tips.,See above
0,2.0,Not so much,"This product is mediocre. At least it doesn’t leave residue, but it’s not very effective either. The surface but it was used on was barely soiled with a few crumbs. Yet, it didn’t even thoroughly pick up as expected."
1,4.0,sticky goo go brr,sticky goo go brr
2,3.0,You get what you pay for.,"The product can aid in cleaning in tight areas but it won't pick all the dirt, lint, and other debris up. I'm sure there is a more expensive product that may be able to work better. For the price it will do the work."
3,3.0,Just not impressed,This product has nice smell and easy to use. No greasy residue. It does not go deep into crevices so some crumbs and dust remain.
4,3.0,I wasn’t impressed,I am a very detailed person and the product did not remove much. I purchased the product to clean the crumbs and debris that collect around the gear in the car and to also remove dust from the car vent.
5,5.0,Gross and Awesome,Does a great job picking things up!
6,5.0,Great for those small places,I plan on having this in my personal inventory.  Works great no residue.
7,4.0,It could be better,Doesn’t pick up as much as I was expecting
8,5.0,Amazing!!!,I ordered this stuff because for the price I figured if it turned out to be a bust I wouldn’t be that upset. But it was amazing. My son and I cleaned my car and we had so much fun with this stuff. He is seven so he wanted to use the “gooey stuff”. And that’s how easy this stuff is to use that my six year old was cleaning all the cracks and crevices of our car. I bought two and we only used one to clean all the cracks and crevices of our car and it’s still usable. It made my car look nice and detailed which is really hard to do with all these kids and animals and their messes!
9,5.0,Amazing,I only just used it yesterday and I got the request  to review it today. Awesome product and smells great. It’s like slime but it actually serves a purpose.
0,5.0,Easy to Use,"I think it works well, considering it come from a can. It definitely picks up crumbs, tiny bits of dirt and debris. I keep it in my glove  box and a hot car doesn’t affect getting the job done."
1,3.0,"Its what looks like, Gak.","Works well for tight spaces but if the dirt or dust as been stewing in moist environments you will have build up that the Gak toy can't remove.Best for dusty, crumby touch ups along the way."
2,5.0,Works as designed and advertised,"Works great, and my kid likes to help clean the car now also because you know... slime!"
3,3.0,Sort of works,"Was trying to clean out the bottom metal part where the car seats glide front and back. Placed cleaning gel over it. It was too firm. I live in FL and it's June, I expected it to be more slimey and a little less ""solid."" It just flopped over. I used my fingers to squish it into the track, it formed itself almost back to shape.So I had to do what it tells you not to do. I flattened as much as possible and left it in the hot early summer heat. It finally turned into slime and it worked! But I had to spend extra time scraping it off which I didn't mind, however, this made this cleaning gel a one time use product. It worked, but it's not worth the price to clean up when it turns into a single use item."
4,3.0,Not like the video,"I purchased this product to clean my car console. The video of product looks so easy and works wonderful. I didn’t get the results I was hoping for. Product did lift some sand and debree from some areas, product would then leave pieces all over. Very inexpensive… which leads me to believe, you get what you pay for."
5,5.0,Very easy to use. Cleans well. Nice sent.,The gel worked great at getting dust out of all those nooks and crevices in the dashboard. Very easy to use but be sure to store it in a plastic bag after you open the jar or it will dry out.
6,5.0,As described,As described. I was able to remove the crumbs and debris in the cracks of the console that I was unable to clean with a towel or vacuum. Worked great.
7,5.0,Nice invention!,This thing works well. The only bad thing about it is that the little particles stay stuck in the glue and it drives me nuts because I want to pick it out. But that would be way too time consuming and nobody has time for that. But I like it and I think I’ll get another one when I need it!
8,5.0,It works,I used it for the intake vents of a Dyson fan
9,4.0,Not as ADVERTISED!,"UPDATE to my review:Although I do not recommend this product, I have to admit the company (Seller) was showed great concern and communicated with me, expressing their concern to my review and the product. I was advised that they removed the product (manufacturer). Due to their great communication, I changed my review and recommend this seller.Original postAlthough the putty did pick up some dirt, it did not work as advertised. My kids (wife) spilled sugar from sour candies and I tried to pick it up and the putty did not work. I used a wet paper towel and got the mess up quicker and more efficiently.I would not recommend this item."
0,2.0,Not worth it,It took several times to pick up only a few pieces and it did not get anything in the vents or small areas. A cloth can do the same thing
1,5.0,This stuff does work,I used it to clean out cup holders in my car and it did a decent job.  It is pretty easy to use and put back in the jar.
2,5.0,This REALLY works.,Seems to good to be true. But it’s not. This goop cleaned parts of my car console that I haven’t been able to reach. The fine lines and nooks and crannies were all dust and dirt free in no time. Have bought again.
3,5.0,Putty,Love how well it gets the dust in cracks
4,5.0,Great for dust,Great to pick up dust. Wouldn’t want to use it for heavier items like crumbs and stuff like that.
5,5.0,Interesting product.,"I wanted to try this car detailing gel/glob for dust in the car and the vents. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do, picks up dust and is great at getting dust out of the car vents. I’m glad I bought it."
6,5.0,Great product,I like it
7,5.0,It really does work!,It does what they say it will.
8,3.0,Okay,It was okay.. not quite the quick sticky pick up I expected it to be.  Hard to work at it a bit.
9,5.0,EASY TO USE!!!!,"After you get used to the texture in your hand, this little product is AMAZING!!! I have a GSD and it picks up that hair like no other"
0,3.0,Not easy to clean,"I use these to clean my car, not work so good. I like the feeling when I hold in my hand. But it’s not easy to clean and the gel will separate when you use water to wash it."
1,5.0,Limpieza al detalle,No solo para el auto sino para los dispositivos electrónicos como teclados y consolas de juego
2,2.0,Not what I expected,Tried it first on my lap top key board and I did absolutely nothing. Then tried in my SUV and again absolutely nothing so I returned it.
3,5.0,Great find,"Wasn't sure if this would work, but tried it since it was on sale.  Worked great on car dash and computer key board - all I have tried so far."
4,5.0,Wow!  It’s fun and works too!,"Took this immediately to my car to get all the fine dust and crumbs in my car.  It did exactly what I expected it to do, squished into all the small spaces and cracks and cleaned them."
5,5.0,Most fun way to clean the car.,This is like putty I played with as a child but not too sticky on my hands. It was fun to press in to crevises and see all the dust disappear!!!
6,5.0,Great for hard to reach spots!,Great for hard to reach spots that a towel cannot reach. Good for getting those crevasses in fans! Easy to store and out away. I love the idea that I can use this and I don’t have to waste paper towels nor other disposable products.
7,5.0,Unique Cleanser,It works great for dust and crumbs
8,5.0,Doesn't stick! Cleans up well!,Really happy! I just keep it in my center console and use it at stop lights or in the car wash!
9,4.0,"It was okay, but not amazing","After looking at videos of the gel cleaner, I was curious. It was not an expensive product but it is a single-use product and I think a vacuum, wet cloth, and brush worked as well. After the gel collected dirt pieces and I moved on to another area it left behind the dirt particles in the next area. It was okay, but to clean all the areas of my car I needed more than one jar and that seemed impractical to me."
0,4.0,Crumbs and dust be gone.,"Dust and crumbs stuck to this like a charm. Used it in the cars and my keyboards. The only issue I had was some residue and small pieces that would come off and stick. I blame the Texas heat though. I noticed it in the vehicles and not the keyboards. Still, worked well."
1,2.0,Same as kids slime,It’s just kids slime you can get at the 99 cent store.
2,5.0,Very useful!,Love this stuff!
3,4.0,picks up well,I would have given it 5 stars except I didn't realize once it has been used a couple times you have to throw it away. You can't rinse it out. If I had known that I would have vacuumed the bigger stuff before using it. I only figured that out because it says to keep it dry with No other instructions. so I would assume If I hadn't seen that I would have tried to rinse and reuse.
4,4.0,Great stocking stuffer!,Excellent for vehicle dashboard or computer keyboards so ideal gift for most people! Helps pick up everything from lint and dust to crumbs.
5,2.0,I can do the same with a can of air or armor all wipe,Bought this just to see what it was capable of doing and thought that it was a novel idea. That said realistically I can do the same thing with an armor all wipe in my vehicle or a good can of air or toothbrush (if your keyboard is really bad)..  It pretty much only lifts surface dust with ease.. anything else you're going to be pushing it into cracks/crevices and I can do that but better with other tools.
6,5.0,Pick up anything!,"Just be certain not to drop on the ground! It is fantastic for detailing autos/trucks, picks up dust, hair, cleans vents and hard to get at places you can’t clean, just push it in and around the area or vent to clean and simply pull out slowly, stays together well, was it up and it cleans itself, do again on the next vent, keyboard or what u want to clean"
7,3.0,Is ok,Good for dust but ok
8,3.0,Works Okay,"I was hoping it would work a little better. I had to go over the same area several times for it to pick up anything. Also, it did not clean as well as I had hoped. Not sure how many more uses I will get with it."
9,5.0,Gets rid of the nasties!,"I’m not a car care freak, but I despise nasty dirty vehicles.  This goop makes deep cleaning nice and easy.  If you have texture problems or you are a clean freak, put on a set of latex gloves, because this will get dirty and feels a little tacky / slimey.If you want to clean hard little crevasses and hard areas to reach, just get this."
0,4.0,Very good goo !!! It picked up the dirt in every deep ridge in my dashboard and console.,I like it but you can’t reused it!
1,4.0,Fun to use,I was skeptical of this Cleaning Gel but really needed something to get into all the tiny crevices and cracks in my car. My daughter and I detailed our cars this weekend and this seemed to work well and we had fun using it to see if it really cleaned everything. It seemed to do the job so the next task is to see how it works after we cleaned it and put it back in the jar.
2,5.0,"I had my doubts, but this is awesome stuff",This is my new favorite car cleaning item. It's wonderful at getting into small places that rags can't get to. My cup holders are so clean now and the smell is really nice too. I definitely recommend this for your vehicle.
3,4.0,Gets into the vents and speaker grills easily…,Since I’ve only used it once I can give 4 stars. If it lasts a few more times we will see what happens. It’s not too expensive so I’m thinking I will be able to use it 3 or 4 times before it’s too dirty to use anymore.I will say it does a great job in getting into the slats of the car vents and even the speaker grills. Not perfect but what is?
4,4.0,Works Great But...,"This works great ! It get all the good out of all the crooks and cranies. I've gotten quite distracted working with this. However, I am not sure why but at some point it gets wet and icky and hard to manage as it sticks and doesn't let go. If it lasted longer it would be the best!"
5,2.0,Not too good,Does not clean keyboards or air vents that good
6,5.0,Great Product,Surprisingly good
7,2.0,Unnecessary product,This is not a product that you need on regular basis it’s only needed once every other month if needed. Be smart and save your money.
8,3.0,Just slime,All it is is slime. Works after a couple times of pushing in on a keyboard.
9,5.0,Great product,"I really didn't think this would work, but it does.  I have used on the computer keyboard, and inside the car.  Wish I had gotten it sooner."
0,5.0,Works likeagic,I gets the job done quickly
1,4.0,Good product,Good
2,5.0,It works,Gel works as advertised. I used it on my laptop and car. It cleans well.
3,4.0,Product works as describes,"Product itself was fine but the jar was difficult to open.  The white cardboard top separated from the aluminum foil over the jar opening and had to be cut off.  Not crazy about that.  Otherwise, it's okay."
4,5.0,Great stuff!,I used to clean in my car
5,2.0,Doesn't work like expected,Sure it'll pick up some dirt particles and dust but it doesn't get into the tiny crevices like I thought it would
6,5.0,Love it!,"Perfect keyboard cleaner, but I don’t know if you clean the putty or throw it away when it becomes very dirty"
7,3.0,was good for a few cleanings,I got this to pick up the tiny particles in cracks of my car worked well.
8,5.0,Such a neat idea,I ordered this to use in the car but found it practical at my desk as well. It works great. Makes the perfect gift for only five dollars.
9,5.0,Great product!!,I used it a little when it first came worked great. It has been so hot that I haven’t been able to use it anymore.
0,4.0,Took a chance,"I use it to clean my car especially the vents and it works, I managed to get rid of dust. I don’t let my vehicle get too dirty. I dust my vehicle every week and the longest is 1 week and a half. Whatever residue it leave it easily come off. This is a initial review I can’t say how many uses I will get out of it."
1,5.0,Really Wrks,"Got this for my Grandson to usend he loves it.  Good buy,"
2,3.0,It was alright,I was loving the idea of this! Yet I used it twice and it doesn’t seem to pick up the dust now as much.
3,5.0,Used in small amounts with no issues.,"Product exactly as advertised. I pulled off a small amount, (the size of two quarters), cleaned my car and threw away the gunk it had accumulated. It was about 50 outside so not too hot or cold for the product to work. Stretched, pulled and turned like you would play dough as I went along to get dirt embedded in the gel. I had a very small amount of gel residue in two places and it picked up with my wad of gel product."
4,5.0,Easy to use cleaning gel for a lot of different types of things,Make it easy to clean small Dust and stuff out of the cracks in your car. So simple and easy to use. It’s a smaller jar so it is easy to store in many places even your car without taking up a lot of space.
5,5.0,I LOVE THIS STUFF,It works as advertised.  My car has two display screens that CONSTANTLY attract dust and airborne debris.  This thing fixes the problem. I'm so glad I made this purchase. It fits right in my cup holder.
6,5.0,For my car,I got this to clean the tiny crevices in my car. Works like a charm and my car is as clean as when it was brand new
7,5.0,It works great,This is the second time I've bought this product  and I love it.
8,4.0,like it,Easy to clean
9,3.0,Make it gooier,"Putty is a bit stiff and not as pliable as noted. Perhaps I should sit on it. Doesn’t squeeze its way into the vents as shown and needs to be jammed onto surfaces to remove debris. Not picking up much grime in tight areas because it isn’t soft enough to squish itself into corners, vents…"
0,4.0,Works for the price,"Product works well enough, I was expecting it to pick up more, but for the value it works."
1,2.0,I rated it this way because it was like silly putty,Reinvention  of silly putty I grew up with
2,5.0,It’s amazing,It’s amazing at first I didn’t think it would work but it does really goood for places you can get to
3,4.0,Great for hard to reach places and for gritty residue and dust.  Fun to play with too!,I purchased this for the cup holders and compartments in our vehicles.  It works good for vents in the das too.In the house I have used it in hard to reach places.  I like itIt is also fun as a fidget toy for adults!
4,4.0,To my surprise it works.,This product works great at getting to those hard to reach spots in my car. I reccomend this product.
5,3.0,Alright,"It is alright, but it doesn't pick up all over yhe crumbs & dust as they make you believe..  I did break off smaller pieces to use & throw it away after it becomes too gross.."
6,5.0,It works!,Grabs all the dirt and dust I used to have to try and get with a tooth brush. That didn’t even work as well.
7,2.0,Love the idea,I brought this because everyone bragged about its awesomeness. I like the idea for this product but i rather use a hand rag. Major dust piled up yes it will clean fast. Little dirt here and there turned to be more difficult. rubbing to get it can cause separation of small pieces. Recommend 5/10. I wont buy again.
8,5.0,unique item exceeds expectation,exclnt for deep cleaning on anything with irregular surface. i.e computer keyboards and autoconsoles. long lasting and not too sticky-unless you are dirt.
9,5.0,Removes dust from black surfaces,"This works well for cleaning typical car interiors, especially hard black finishes. Have used this more than a dozen times and it still picks up those pesky (and highly visible) particles that I can't seem to get rid of any other way. Worth the money for me."
0,5.0,Worth the purchase,"In the military we had ""white glove inspection"" daily and if we had this product there would be no gigs or demerits at all!Cleans car very well and the tell tale dust and dead skin (yes, I said it) disappears"
1,4.0,Its Just something to get off of Amazon,"Its really just slime, it really does pick stuff I cant get in my car with a shop vac like tight spaces but other than that its really a one time use type of items not really mad at this product."
2,3.0,Not as advertised but does good work!,I’ve realized this is a one time use product. It does good work around cup holders but that’s about it for me.Also for hard to get out of package; the gel was stuck to the cap wrapper!?
3,5.0,Love this stuff!,"I’ve always wanted to try stuff like this! It actually works! I can’t believe how much stuff it picks up in the car, on the console, drink holder etc. Great stuff!"
4,2.0,Not useful,Don’t like it.
5,5.0,Perfect,Perfect for car cleaning getting into tight places.
6,4.0,Works on dust in car,I like to clean the dust in my car on dash and vents
7,5.0,Awesome,Easy to use
8,2.0,Ewwww…a terrible mess second time I went to use.,"I tried ‘a chunk’ of this when I got it new.  Then put the used back in the jar with the remainder and never opened it again for 9 months.  Ewww, what a mess.  That which looked darker from being previously used was all runny.  After a big mess I was able to get the runny stuff in a shop towel and made the remainder just stiff enough to stay together (pretty well) and tried using it.  It just wasn’t worth the hassle, so I quit and threw it away.  If this is made for a one-time-only use, it makes it really expensive to use.  I will not buy this again."
9,5.0,As sticky as advertised,"I wish I had known about this sooner, it makes spot cleaning the car so much easier and faster. Everyone should get some"
0,5.0,I did an ok job,It definitely helped with deep places. It’s easy and fast.
1,5.0,gooey helper,I love this product.  Helped me get grim out of the little areas around my gear shift and sterring wheel
2,5.0,Excellent stuff!!,"I bought this primarily for my car, but quickly realized it was excellent for a ton of knick-knacks around my home."
3,4.0,Decent,"Picks stuff up, but you can't wash it so when it gets too dirty you have to get a new one. Also, I have had it go slimy before. Not sure if that's from being in the car or what."
4,5.0,Really fun to use,"I really liked how quickly it picked up dust, it did get a little crusty but it’s been super fun to use and just roll around to get little dirt that’s in crevices"
5,5.0,Great,This product worked well. I used it to dust both my car and computer. It got every particle of dust without leaving a sticky residue on my hands or tube items cleaned…fantastic!
6,5.0,works great,"Love it for cleaning interior of car and truck! easy to use , and picks ups stuff like sand that’s hard to remove! Love it going to order 2 more at least!"
7,5.0,Easy to use.,Nice
8,5.0,Works really well! Best part... it doesn't stick to you,It works really well!And thr best part.  .. it doesn't stick to you. Lol and can we talk about how pretty the color is lol
9,4.0,Great products,For cleaning the car
0,4.0,Works,I actually bought this to try to use for getting dog hair off my couch
1,5.0,works like a charm,"Great product, great find.  Does the job getting those spots that drive a person that is a little OCD crazy."
2,5.0,Good product,Works like I thought
3,2.0,It smudges the glass and high gloss wood on the dash.,"I bought the product because it comes in a container and looked like it could be used many times over. However, the first time I used it, I got smudges all over the high gloss surfaces of my dash. The product was too wet. I had to use winded to clean up my gauge covers and wood panels."
4,4.0,Works great!,Worked as expected
5,5.0,Love it!,Great product!
6,5.0,Great for small and hard to get spots,"It works really well on key boards, car vents and all the little places that are hard to get to. I use it to clean the laptops all the time. I use it in all the cars to get the small places I can't get to. It is super easy to use."
7,5.0,the best for my computer keyboard,"I eat at my desk, so my keyboard can get nasty. This really did the job, will purchase again."
8,5.0,cleans car dash fast,cleans car dash fast
9,4.0,Perfect Christmas gift!,My wife loves this cute little blob. As advertised and fun to use. I’m
0,5.0,Good cleaning  method  in the car.,It was easy to use and did a good job picking up the  small debris in the cars.
1,4.0,Bueno,Bueno
2,5.0,Fun,"Fun to use. No sticky residue left behind. You can only use it a few times, then it's done."
3,5.0,Great product for cleaning grooves & vents,"I’ve never used anything like this before but it works great thru out car.  Just a quick note, don’t use in a hot car or with heater on. It turns gooey. Also be careful cleaning vents & spaces hard to retrieve gel from."
4,3.0,Does what it is advertised to do  but way overpriced!,"I purchased this in hopes that it was a revolutionary new formula for cleaning dust and dirt particles from our cars. It does what it is advertised to do but in the end it is just another product on Amazon that has been re-marketed for another use.  You can get the same product at a famous national US Dollar store chain for a buck! Just got to your local dollar store, go to the toy section and get some fart putty. It is identical to this product. We have been using it for years to detail cars. Not only is fart putty it 1/5th the price of this but you get twice as much!"
5,3.0,Not as useful as I was hoping,It's easy to use but for some one that has pollen on the vents and in the car it doesn't really pick up that kind of dirt...
6,5.0,Works well for a quick cleaning agent,Great for quick cleaning or tight places.  It’s one step below using a toothbrush and soapy water but great solution for tough hard to reach areas with particles or crumbs. Only tear off what you need just a small piece can effectively clean your car.
7,4.0,Good for price,I loved this thing but when it got too dirty I tried wetting it to get all dirt out and it fell apart.
8,3.0,Car cleaner,"It’s okay could feel more jelly, feels like a solid jelly, didn’t really pick up as much dirt as I thought."
9,5.0,It works as advertised,It works as advertised
0,4.0,Hair inside the jar,"Just received my cleaning gel. Brand new/unopened, and there’s a hair inside the bottom of the jar.Updating my review to 4 stars because they reached out to me and sent a new one, sans hair. Thanks PULIDIKI."
1,4.0,good,like how it gets into the small cracks and cleans the area well.
2,5.0,Slime away the grime,Use this to clean the grime from my cup holders in my car and my computer key board.
3,5.0,Perfect,When I got this product I had my car in mind but it works awesome on my keyboard and my desk phone at work it’s like a dust magnet.
4,3.0,Not as good as the videos,This works alright but not as well as the video.
5,5.0,Worked as intended!,"I used this for my keyboard, thats several years old now, and it worked like a charm.  I highly recommend it!"
6,5.0,Cleaning is easy than ever,"It is easy to use and clean a difficult areas in your car , computers, some furnitures without damage then"
7,5.0,‼️ FREAKY GOOD,I can’t believe how good this stuff really worked! I had a really dirty cupholder and credenza in my truck. My wife left the stuff on it and everything cleaned right up! This is the cleanest micro Danza has been since the day I bought my truck. Great stuff.
8,4.0,It works and gets the yukkies in all those hard to get into spaces,it does  what it says it supposed to do.  Interesting goo.  Good for the price paid.
9,5.0,Cleaning Gel,works great on keyboards also
0,5.0,That it works,I love how it really picked up the dust in my car.
1,3.0,"works good, but not overly impressed",works as described but not overly impressed with the cleaning ability
2,3.0,Disappointed,"Smells like that slime kids get at the arcade with a couple hundred tickets. Don't understand how it's supposed to pick up stuff. Used it on my mom's car console when detailing and while it did pick up some debris, it left stuff behind too if I didn't rotate the blob a lot. And I don't understand how to clean it because it says not to but I can imagine it getting real stank after time."
3,4.0,Super easy product,Works super well you just kind of have to press it in firmly but works well for car vents etc! Unsure how long this pot will last me before I need to replace it before it stops to stick!
4,3.0,Ehhhh,"Finally tried it, while it did pick stuff up a lot of it just fell right back off. Anything bigger than a pea size would just fall off."
5,2.0,turns to sticky mess in weeks!,"Tested it when it arrived, and it worked ok. I left it in my garage that's surrounded on three sides by earth and stays cool, so ""store in a cool place"" was conformed to. But now 8 weeks later, the medium has seperated into sticky gel and liquid, and is no longer usable. I bought it in advance to detail a car I will be selling soon, but with the time lapse it's too late to exchange for working product.Stand warned- Use it quickly or maybe it needs to be refrigerated?!"
6,5.0,It works well,I liked how it cleaned my remotes tablet and computers it's awesome.
7,5.0,Worth the money,Worth the money
8,4.0,deep cleaned my car!,very helpful in deep cleaning my car. i had to rip it apart since once its dirty it cant be reused. sucks i cant keep it in my car since it needs to stay at a certain temperature :( but other than that its worth it :) not sure why theyre asking about scent but it smells kind of rubbery? almost like crocs? lol
9,5.0,Easy to use!,I love this stuff. It really works
0,3.0,Too Firm,"This product is too firm. I have tried to loosen it up, it will not."
1,2.0,dust cleaning gel,was not impressed.
2,3.0,Doesn't work that well...,"It picked up some dust in my car, but barely helped the pet hair situation."
3,2.0,Its fun but doesn't get EVERYTHING,I like this stuff just wish it was a tiny bit stickier. It works well for larger debris but struggles to pick up small dust unless I wipe it around all over a couple of times.
4,2.0,Not as nearly as good as a handheld car vacuum,"It's easy to use, just not very good. It gets light dust off things in your car, but not as well as a handheld car vacuum or even a damp cloth."
5,5.0,Does what it should.,Easy to get the dust and dog hair out of the vents of my 4Runner.
6,4.0,Perfect for my car detailing.,I bought this for detailing my car. Gets in the tiny spaces and works like a charm. I bought 2. One for the car and one for the boat.
7,5.0,Works great,Used it in my car it removed everything from all the little spaces.
8,4.0,It worked!,"It really did get the crumbs ans small particles from the crevices on my car dashboard and my computer keyboard. The  only problem is it didn't come with instructions on whether you can ""clean"" it or if it's only for so many uses then you trash it 🤷🏾‍♀️"
9,5.0,fantastic,Seems like a weird product but once you use it to clean your cars nooks you will never go back to any other way
0,2.0,Un-predictable batches. Don’t buy,"Ok. So pictures show a nice “slime like” cleaning gel that looks stretchy but not too stretchy that it leaves behind pieces of it…. & also shows it actually STRETCHES…. I got a 2 pack and NEITHER of them stretch out at all… it’s like “over-activated slime” where u go to gently stretch & it breaks clean apart down the middle… or close by.. It didn’t pick up ANY DUST… again, Over Activated.I’m reading reviews that say it’s TOOOO stretchy & etc.. they should just try needing into it a bit before using, like you would with slime.. That would help a bit. If not. A drop or 2 of contact solution could help.But I had the complete opposite experience. This stuff was SOOO OVER activated that nothing would even stick to it. Complete waste of money.I’m getting the sense that this company has a recipe for their gel that isn’t always correctly followed & it comes out either too sticky & gooey or not gooey & sticky enough.  Will be returning for a refund. I’ll find a better reviewed product"
1,3.0,It's nice but to each their own,"It collects dusk well, but didn't pick up dirt in the little cracks of my shift and car counsel. Had to use toothpicks for that. Other than that for daily dirt, yea, but not helpful like I thought it would."
2,5.0,Cleaning keyboard,I have only used it on the keyboard so far and it has done a great job!!
3,4.0,Worked well,"This worked well for getting into all the cracks and crevices in the car, only complaint is a little to much fragrance, should have worn gloves to touch it."
4,5.0,Don’t let the bad reviews scare you,
5,5.0,Works Great,"This stuff is wonderful, works like a charm. My car looked like it was professionally detailed. Only wish they would have told you if there is a way to clean the ""Gel"".  Highly recommended!!"
6,5.0,Easy to use,I love this gel!  It makes my car look so clean each time I use it!  I even made car kits for prizes and the winners couldn’t wait to use it!
7,5.0,Very useful,This is very good. It helps keep my car free from small dust. I would recommend this cleaning gel.
8,3.0,Works ok,"On to use, not sure it picked up like it should. Hard to trust a product that smells funny made in China."
9,5.0,Great Product,Love every thing about it.  Cleans as advertised!  No residue!
0,5.0,Really works!,My husband was very skeptical but I ordered it anyway and WOW. It worked exactly as advertised. Great delivery of a very cool product
1,5.0,"Great job, easy to use.","Does a great job that many other applications will not do well or easily. It works so well, I bought another for a good friend."
2,3.0,Too stiff,This gel is not soft enough to penetrate into crevices easily. Leaves bits of gel behind.
3,5.0,Great product,Easy to use and quick cleaning
4,5.0,I'll buy it again.,The one I bought?  It fell out of my hand into the gravel.  Some of the gravel was removed from the gel and what gel was left worked really well.
5,5.0,Perfect,This worked great!  I loved it.  It really got to areas I haven’t been able to clean before.
6,5.0,Very cool goo,Amazing goo to get into the nooks and crannies in the car leaves everything amazing!!
7,5.0,Works perfectly.,I have seen this many times and wanted to try it.  It worked great.
8,3.0,"Ehh, coo at first",So I’ve had mine for about a month. It does okay with getting up dust and stuff in the car but I feel like it just gets too dirty too fast.
9,5.0,Easy car cleaning,I love how easy it is to clean up my car
0,5.0,Works wonders,"If you have small crevices in your car that collects dust, dirt and sand this is great at getting into those small spots! I was skeptical that it would get stuck and I’d have little slime spots everywhere but it didn’t! It also didn’t leave a slimy residue that I also thought it would. I was going to buy the “pink stuff cleaner” that is popular on social media right now, but this was cheaper and did the exact same thing! I’m going to be purchasing more to use on my keyboard at work. Great stuff!"
1,5.0,Good stuff,"Did a great job of picking up dust, hair, and other junk that's hard to get."
2,5.0,Nice!,Really like this gel to get in the small crevices in your car that you normally can’t get to.. doesn’t leave any gel on the surfaces.
3,5.0,Multiple Uses,"Auto, PC keys/screen"
4,4.0,Gift,Giftable
5,5.0,So easy!,This stuff is amazing!  Super easy to use got right down in the crevices!
6,3.0,Doesnt work,I was looking for it to stick to crumbs or dust in the cracks. It does very minimal sticking
7,5.0,Easy To Ue,Getting dust out of seam on six panel doors.  Worked with almost no effort.
8,5.0,I love this stuff so much! Works great!!! I keep it in my car.,"This product is awesome. I keep it in reach in my car for dog hair, dust, and sticky spills. It’s a wonder and is reusable time and again. Get some!!"
9,3.0,Works well!,"Easy to use, but didn’t exceed my expectations."
0,4.0,Would purchase again,Would purchase again
1,3.0,Not sure it was worth it,"I love keeping my car clean.  This little blob has its use.  I find if trying to get the irritating crumbs and dirt from a felt lined coin pocket such as my Jeep Grand Cherokee has in front of gear shift, the blob sticks to the felt and trying to get the remaining broken off pieces is a laboring task!  Also, in little cracks and air vents and groves this doesnt work very well.  I still have to get my old tooth brush to dust out those areas.The blob gets dirty and not sure how to clean it."
2,5.0,Pro level,"Cleaned 20 years of grime off old keyboard in no time flat. Worked better than sprays and wipes, and way way faster. Fun, too."
3,4.0,They work better than I thought they would,"They do work better than I thought they would, however it really takes a lot of time to try to get everything. They seem to get dirty pretty quick and lose their stickiness. But for TV remote, game controllers, and household electronics they work great."
4,3.0,Mediocre,"The gel was good at picking up particles in flat areas, but did not get the dust out of crevices.  I tried to roll and massage the gel into the corners, and was left a bit disappointed.  Also, since the louvers of the air vents don't lock, that made it hard to get the gel in-between to pick up dust."
5,5.0,Great cleaning gel,Works as advertised!  Nice product at a reasonable price.
6,4.0,Great for cleaning my car!,This product is awesome for cleaning my dashboard and tight spaces in my car. My dashboard is a dark color and attracts tons of dust. The only issue I have with this product is I wish there was a way to clean it so it can be used many more times but I should get a few uses at least before it is totally unusable due to all the gunk it collects. But at least it's cheap so I will definitely purchase more when needed. Definitely recommend purchasing this product!!!
7,5.0,Good product and quick delivery,Using product to clean tough spots in my auto
8,4.0,liked it  did not  love it,"worked ok on a few keyboards and car vents , but byt eh time we did a first use , the goo seemed dirty and full of substances ...not sure if it is a one-time use product or can we use it for future clean-ups ?  first use was solid , it was inexpensive ."
9,2.0,Doesn’t really work,It’s slime that you could totally make this at home with your kids. That’s the consistency. I was expecting something with a bit more stickiness and this falls short. I tried it all over my car and gave it two stars because it does at least pick up some of the larger things like bits of straw wrapper or small pieces of gravel. But dust? Not at all.
0,4.0,It does pick up dirt and dust,"I used it on my computer keyboard and in my car.  Does not work as well as I would like, (maybe I am looking for a magic wand) but it works.  Have no idea how long it will last.  I did put it in a zip lock bag immediately after I was done."
1,3.0,Became runny after a few months,"Worked great at first but after using a half dozen times on my keyboard, it has become runny.  Goopy particles would stick to my hand when picking it up. It was a few months old when it started to happen but the amount of use was minimal. Had to throw it away."
2,5.0,It works great!!,I used it to clean my new car. I was impressed. Easier to use than armor all. It got in the cracks and crevasses pretty good. I don’t really have time to clean my car a lot but it was kinda fun.
3,5.0,Amazing product,Even used it on my car mats and rug and it picked up everything
4,3.0,It doesn’t work that great.,It doesn’t work that great.  The purpose behind it makes sense but the actual product does not pick up the lint or dirt in the crevices.
5,4.0,Cleaned my car well,"Bought this to clean up areas I couldn't get, and it did a very good job. Not perfect, but very good."
6,5.0,Great for hard to clean spaces,I found it very easy to use and it did great job removing dirt I couldn’t get with anything else.  Would order again
7,1.0,Do not buy this product.,"The product does not come with any instructions on the container. The container is shrink-wrapped, so there are no instructions in or on a box. It is good for one or two uses only and should be used up within a few days after opening or it turns to liquid goo. Even if you use it immediately it leaves a gooey film on your fingers and whatever it is you're trying to clean, which logically means it attracts more dust. Silly putty would be more effective."
8,5.0,Great product,"The product did a great job removing lint, crumbs, etc. from keyboard and car interior."
9,4.0,Meets expectations,I am pleased with this product it meets my expectations. Not a quibble but slightly more tech would be helpful but I got the complications.
0,4.0,Worked great for what I needed,It worked great for what I needed it for
1,4.0,Works pretty good!!,Would buy again.
2,2.0,Turns to slime,Works well at first but turns into slime after a few weeks and can't be used.  I had to throw it away.
3,5.0,Awesome stuff,Love it. My husband thought I was crazy but he loves it.
4,3.0,Great idea,The gel works good for dust and loose debris. Not so great for more stubborn and sticky dirt.
5,5.0,Great!,I’ve been wanting one of these to get the dust and crumbs out of the nooks & crannies of my car. Love it!
6,4.0,Lo recomiendo,Fácil de usar
7,5.0,I really like this product.  The batch is good I even used it on the fabric seats,100 percent recommend this product it worked really well.
8,5.0,Great for cleaning small places,I love this product! It really picks up all the dust and dirt in all the small places in the car. Easy to use and comes off the surface very easy. Cleans the vent covers and console area fast and easier than spraying chemicals.
9,3.0,picks up good but don’t know how to clean in all the way,no
0,4.0,Never used it.,Waste of my money. Never used it
1,5.0,Very easy for removing crumbs and dust,Great for someone like me who eats in the car a lot. It picks up the crumbs in odd places. It is also great at removing dust.
2,3.0,Hard to pull apart,It’s very hard to put in the vents and clean you can clean everything else but the purpose was to clean the vents
3,5.0,Perfect,Used this in an rv to. Lean window slides and it was amazing! Got stuff out I was trying to get out for so long! Will be ordering more. Nice to always have on hand.
4,4.0,Nice product to use everywhere,Any cleaning ideas for this??
5,5.0,Works!,Great product for cleaning the vents and hard to reach areas in my car.
6,3.0,Just okay,I was expecting something kind blown based on all the rave but it didn’t really get the cracks and crevices like I was hoping and threw it away after I was done.
7,3.0,save your money,"doesn't work for cracks and crevices, just whatever is on the surface. Save your money."
8,4.0,Convenient cleaner to keep in vehicle,It picks up dust and light debris quite nicely. It’s not able to grab anything that isn’t totally loose so scratching stick particles to loosen then use the product works pretty good. Gets debris in corners pretty good too
9,3.0,Unusual product,Works ok but not sure how to get the junk outta the gel for the next use.
0,3.0,Fell apart too easy,"It picked up dust okay, but when I tried to use it, especially in the car, it fell apart. Maybe I just didn't know how to use it properly. I won't buy it again."
1,5.0,IT WORKS,"I've been seeing a lots of ads about cleaning gels and I didn't really think it'll work. So I told myself ""what the heck"" and bought it just to try it out. Omg, it WORKS. There was a lot of pollen and dust in my car and it pick it up so easily. It's worth every penny and I love it so much especially in cup holders that tends to be hard to clean. I really do reccomend this product. Keep in mind, this is a gel so dont leave it in hot places like your car or it will melt."
2,5.0,I bought this and it did an amazing job removing the dust in my car.  Highly recommend this.,This worked great getting the dust out of the crevices.
3,5.0,Super easy,Easy to use
4,4.0,Works but not stretchy,"Definitely not stretchy like the picture suggests. Although, it does the job. If it was a bit more stretchy it would fit better into most places. But dirt and dust sticks to it, so it's not terrible. Oh and it does smell really good but not an overpowering scent. Kind of a laundry detergent scent."
5,4.0,Fun for the kids,"If you are a slime-free household like we are, your kids WILL want to clean using this. You’re welcome.Almost five stars, but not quite as “slimey” as it shows in pictures... you really have to push it into the cracks to get some of the hard to reach places."
6,2.0,Not doing much,Not very helpful. Use a brush or something instead.
7,4.0,I just used it once,"It was used in my car. My Bulldog rides with me everywhere, so I deal with hair. I also deal with Cottonwood trees. Puffy floating stuff. It works so well I wonder how long it will last (?). The only reason I did not give it a 5 Star."
8,4.0,I’d buy it again,"This stuff is easy to use. I like it.  Best for leather where shifter is, doesn’t work as well in tiny cracks in door and along the middle console. Needs to be a little more sticky, not sure it is kinda slimy. I will be getting this again though."
9,5.0,Works good,"A little challenging to take out of container, but works very good."
0,4.0,Picks up all the little itsy bitsy pieces like a champ.,Great for all my kids’ crumby mess. And my husband’s cig ashes all over my dash. Gets in vents really well too without fuss. My family is super messy in the car so this is great for me and maintaining my car once I do a thorough cleaning.
1,4.0,Worked But Came With Confusion,The product was easy to use but came with no instructions or even suggestions for how to best use/reuse the gel itself. Can I rinse the debris off the gel? Will water dissolve it or do I have to reuse it with trash particles already in it? I'm confused.
2,5.0,Awesome and inexpensive.,Worked great for cleaning my cup holders and keyboard
3,3.0,Doesn’t work as well as you’d like it to,Doesn’t work as well as you’d like it to. It picks up maybe 50%. Better then nothing.
4,4.0,Great for touch ups.,"I thought it would pick up a little better, it did pick up the lint and dirt particles after several tries. My car is 4 years old and had more to clean than normal."
5,5.0,Cleaning hard to reach places - GREAT!,I am totally impressed with this product!  It cleans all the hard to reach places such as on keyboards and the crevices in the car.  Not sticky at all and so easy to use.  Love it!
6,5.0,Works well,Works well and as advertised.
7,2.0,Separated after one use,"Worked fairly well the first time, but not quite as sticky and or effective as I expected.  Then, the second time I used it, the ""blob"" separated and is basically unusable."
8,5.0,Cool slime that cleans instead of ruining things!,"I wish the slime my kid makes cleaned like this stuff, it really works well for that dust you just can’t get too. Once it’s dirty you do have to throw it out because it can’t be cleaned. That’s the only drawback."
9,5.0,Works!,"Seems to work well, I store it inside based on some reviews saying the consistency changed after use.  I haven’t experienced that yet after a month, and highly recommend it for its value and performance."
0,1.0,Seriously disappointed,My new car is very clean and I want to keep it that way so I purchased this product. I tried to use it to clean up some very very light debris and it didn't work at all. The only thing it really picked up for me was dust. Wipes do a better job than this in my opinion. Not sure what the hype is all about with this kind of product.
1,2.0,Hard to clean.,"Works great for removing dust, debris, etc from trim panels in my vehicles. Very hard to clean gel afterwards though, gel basically liquifies once you add water to try and clean. No instructions included on how to clean."
2,5.0,all to easy,wish I had this sometime ago I love it.
3,5.0,Excellent product,I really like it. It does well cleaning up crumbs and dust. I would like it to be squishier as it is a little harder than expexred
4,5.0,It really works!,"Great product to clean tiny crevices in your car!! However, be careful if when handling the gel if you have long fingernails."
5,5.0,It works,"First time using and am very happy with this. My car has a textured dash that had gotten pretty dusty from our gravel road. I didn’t want to try soap water and rag as thought it would buildup dirt in between the texture patterns so just rolled the putty all across the dash. Worked great. Dash looks like new.  Then tackled air vents, emergency brake cover and shifter cover. Picked up everything and is still usable. I’m sure we can get a number of cleanings out of one container."
6,2.0,it is not possible to wash the collected dirt from the product,"worked great on my dusty car dashboard. When i attempted to wash the product in the sink, I was unable to clean the dirt out and the product seemed to begin to disintegrate.  I am will just go back to using a rag. This product seems to be a one use item."
7,5.0,Great product for easy cleaning,Great item to have handy in the carPicks up all the dustIt's not made very well for hard to reach areas. It will definitely get the job done for about 90% of areas in the car though
8,5.0,Great,I love it!
9,4.0,Works good,Can get to slimy  in the heat besides that works good
0,3.0,Works ok,Doesn't pick up all the dirt
1,5.0,Amazing product 👌,Worked amazing 👏
2,4.0,Good product,Easy to use and does not stick to hand catches most of the dirt.
3,3.0,More solid,"This is the 2nd of this type of product I've bought. This one is more ""solid"" and doesn't ooze into crevices like the other one I bought, even if I let it sit overnight.  Definitely prefer my other one"
4,2.0,It leaves a residue.,"It was fun for playing but not for cleaning.  While it did pick up some dust, It left a sticky residue that was even harder to clean."
5,3.0,It’s ok,It’s just ok. Mine definitely didn’t spread out like the pictures. It pretty much kept its shape so it made it hard to get into crevices. It’s not loose and slimy. Doesn’t do a great job cleaning and occasionally leaves a residue behind. Doesn’t rinse off well either. Wouldn’t recommend buying it.
6,3.0,Good for maybe one use,"Good for maybe one use, then done. Expensive for cleaning each time, for the price. It's not that $ 5 alot but each time in a week x 2  , yes alot"
7,4.0,Great except for the scent.,"Pretty good stuff, works well.  1 star off for lemon scent... it's not a good lemon, and lemon is so overused. This scent transforms into something very evil in a hot car after using it, more like an ""odor"" from the depths of somewhere gross."
8,5.0,I love it it goes in all the groves,Would buy it again and again
9,4.0,Great for one time use,This cleaning gel works very well as long as you don't try using it more than a couple days after opening it. It absorbs any humidity and it makes it super sticky and unusable. I don't know but it could be a common thing with cleaning gels.
0,2.0,I don't know why I bought it,"This is what I wanted to buy when I bought my car, but after I bought it I realized I didn't even know or need to use it because it was hard to get rid of the dust after it was cleaned and then used as the next cleaning. Because by the time I remembered it was past the time to return it, I had to throw it in somewhere."
1,3.0,Goop….,Not all it’s cracked up to be….lifts light dust at minimum!
2,2.0,Doesn't clean,It leaves residue as you clean. You get some dust then go back to clean the slim
3,5.0,Works,Did the job. Dust removed easily from hard to reach places in my car. Will buy again
4,5.0,As Advertised,This stuff is great! It grabs everything out of all kinds of crevasses (as long as it is loose).There's something about this stuff - it actually makes deep cleaning fun!!
5,2.0,Not like the other brands.,"This product doesn't hold together like the other brands I have used. When using on an auto dash it leaves bids of the product on the dash and on your hands. Maybe I got a bad batch, I used the Justtop brand in the past and had much better results."
6,5.0,best ! Especially for someone like me who smokes  gets all the ashes,great stuff !!!
7,3.0,It’s just okay,"First of all, I love how this gel smells. It does a good enough job, but it seems as though it doesn’t reach into crevices as well as advertised. I’ve used it on my laptop and in my car. It does remove dust as advertised, but you have to manipulate it a little with your fingers in order to get it into deep crevices."
8,3.0,Doesn't pick up crumbs and dust very effectively,While it seems to be pretty damp when first opened it's not super effective for picking up dust and dirt from crevices.
9,2.0,Doesn’t work,"It’s really good in theory… but it just doesn’t stick to much.I guess I should have realized that before purchase.. it can stick to debris while not sticking to your hands at the same time..This is just childrens play slime, rebranded as a car cleaning tool"
0,5.0,Easy to clean hard to reach places,Easy to clean hard to reach places
1,4.0,Shocked at how well this works,"I used this to clean my 2020 Pathfinder. It works well on gear shifter, speedometer column thingamajig. It cleaned inside my cup holders and all nooks and crannies. I am shocked at what came out of my car. Hands down the best $6 I've spent!"
2,5.0,Good stuff,Works as advertised. Good product.
3,3.0,is ok,I was sincerely disappointed with this product..  It does not pick as well as the video says it does.  Tried it in my car small places and did not pick up the dirt.  Would not buy again
4,5.0,Really Works!,"Took a chance on this and am pleasantly delighted! Works well, cleans up nice and stores in original container to be used again."
5,5.0,Good for getting into tight places in the car,Good for cleaning around the console
6,4.0,Cleaning gel...wore out after a couple uses.,"This product is great in that it gets into all the crevices you can’t typically reach with a vacuum. It does grab everything in tough to reach places! I just wish it was a little more tackier so that it can truly grab everything. But it does do a great job!Update: after a couple uses, it stopped working. I feel like it’s just like slime that you can buy for $1. I would not purchased again."
7,3.0,La limpiesa,Se siente util
8,3.0,I thought it would be more guppy then it actually is,"I thought it would be more guppy then it actually is then again the weather can get pretty cold out here, maybe in 100 degrees weather it v will be as guppy as I wish it was so it can pick up more dust"
9,2.0,Doesn't get into crevasses,This did not work for my car.  It did not get into the crevasses of my dash board
0,5.0,Super impressed!,Super easy to use. Does its job very well. No more trying to clean tiny spaces like vents with a toothbrush! Plus the seller went out of their way to make sure we were able to try the product. The first time we ordered it said delivered but never received…they sent another free with no fuss. Very happy with this product and the customer service provided! Will Def buy again!😁
1,2.0,No thanks!,Doesn’t really clean as described.
2,4.0,Cleaning gel,Works great
3,2.0,Gel or liquid?,Worked great the first time.  Went to use it again and it was liquid.  Not so good.
4,4.0,Works great,Worked really well for cleaning all of the small crevices of my center console where dust and tiny crumbs accumulate.
5,3.0,Rara,No es lo q esperaba
6,5.0,Great cleaner,Easy to use. Picked up the gunk.
7,5.0,Amazing! So Happy,Love this product and so does my boyfriend.  A local paint and body shop loved it as well and is ordering for thier clean up department.
8,2.0,NOT WORKING AS ADVERTISED,NOT IMPRESSED
9,4.0,Helpful product for cleaning the hard-to-reach places,"This product works well. My granddaughter loved the scent and had fun helping me “get the crumbs” from their family room table. It worked well, and I’m looking forward to using it in my car. This product is an excellent value, both price-wise and it works."
0,2.0,Fun to smoosh but not cleaning,Tried in car and keyboard.  Did not work but it was fun to smoosh
1,5.0,Cool,I used it for my car
2,4.0,Works as described,Works as designed
3,2.0,Turned to liquid,"After the first few uses, Product turned to liquid and was a complete mess!"
4,5.0,I was unaware of this product until recently and was pleased with the results.,Used it on the interior of my car.  I had picked up a bit of sand while vacationing in Florida.  This product worked great on dash and console and any other surface.
5,3.0,Only good for a few uses,It was easy to use and picked up dirt fairly well. Better than I expected. Problem is it gets dirty very fast and does not have many uses in it. I do do recommend using it on your cell phone or any cameras. It does stick and leave residue on these items.
6,4.0,Good deal,"It works ok, but not as great as I’d hoped on the black interior of my car"
7,3.0,it’s okay,it gets the big stuff and it doesn’t stick to anything but it doesn’t get in the small crevices easily
8,5.0,Wonderful 🥰,This stuff really works !
9,2.0,"It works, I guess.",It works for some things but it doesn’t get things out of the cracks and tight spaces like I thought it would.
0,2.0,yah but no,"i want this stuff to work, but you can find an easy youtube video or tik tok video on making your own that works better.  this slime sticks to your hands"
1,2.0,This product will pick up light surface dust but that's about it.,"I used this product to detail the interior of my car.  It picked up light dust particles but that's about it.  I used in the crevices of the seats and stick shift area and it didn't work very well.  I cannot recommend this product for superior cleaning but if you want to remove surface dust, go ahead or better yet, just use a dust rag."
2,3.0,Gimmicky.,It kind of works but mostly it’s gimmicky
3,5.0,Brand new,Made the interior of my 08 GTi look brand new. Got all the little dust particles and hair out
4,4.0,Works Overall,"It does work, just not in super small crevices. I bought it with the intention of getting food particles out of the crevices in my table. It didn't work so well for that but it worked in the car for larger surfaces."
5,5.0,Great product!,"I had no idea this existed and totally found by accident. I'm so glad I did.This makes getting those hard to reach crevices so much easier to clean with no chemicals, residues or streaks etc. Freaking awesome! Picks up those cat and rabbit hairs I bring in, cigarette ash, and basic pollen and dust.There isn't really a smell. If you grew up playing with and ""Slime"" products from the 60s/70s or late 80s/90s, it smells like that. No order is left in the car after use."
6,4.0,Fair product,"It pick up dust for sure, but Mt car AC vent had a little more than dust, which it wasn't capable to pick up.  That I had to clean with Qtip.  All n all its good for dust only"
7,4.0,Prices,Everything ok
8,5.0,Love it,Works perfect and the price was good
9,2.0,would not buy again,clean cracks in car
0,1.0,Only slightly cleans,"I bought this for my car thinking it would work good, but it barely even picked up the dust. If you have little spots that maybe require more than just a tiny tap to remove. It didn't even get the dust on my cd player ledge or the vents like advertised. I had to go back over it with some car cleaning products bc you could barely see a difference."
1,3.0,gets in between places with ease.,Worked great on my laptop and also buy car. Only thing is I had to rinse it a lot to get dirt off .
2,4.0,Good product,"It's works pretty well, my interior is black so it leave residue behind on the vents after cleaning (but think it's from moisture from the slime) it also doesn't pick up all the dust, but majority. I'm satisfied and will purchase again"
3,5.0,Particles in the car and the computer,"This worked well on the particles, crumbs and dust in the car crevices and in the computer keyboard."
4,4.0,Good Product,Good product for getting dirt & dust out of small seams in a car interior.
5,3.0,Not worth price,Got this product for car care and electronics. Not worth the price. Falls apart when taking out of container and using.
6,5.0,BUY IT!,This will pick up particles in hard to reach places. This worked great for keeping crumbs put of the car.
7,2.0,It’s kids slime,"Wow. My kids are going to be pissed off when they found out I bought this instead of allowing them to mix up borax and Elmer’s glue and get paid $5 and change.It works, but it’s just borax and glue in a wasteful plastic container."
8,5.0,Easy to use,Should have bought this sooner
9,5.0,Absolutly love this product,This product reaches all those spots in your car that are hard to get. I keep my car clean but the inside looks way better after using this.
0,2.0,Just ok,Product was fine for surface dust but not as amazing as I had hoped.
1,5.0,Product is amazing,Item was exactly what I ordered and it was in perfect condition. I received it in perfect shipping time! Finally got to use it and it work just as I thought (amazing)!!!
2,5.0,Works as shown,"Convenient and effective. I expect it to last long enough to be worth the money.  I manage a fleet of several cars, so this a convenient way to keep the console area clean.Someone mentioned that it is the same as dollar store slime. Perhaps it is- I have never seen that product. I think this is a good value."
3,3.0,Not as they say,It’s easy to use but it doesn’t clean as much as I thought
4,2.0,It’s ok … Wouldn’t but again,It’s was ok. Very sticky after it sits for a while. Didn’t trust putting it back on my car’s cup holders
5,2.0,Not worth the $,A good brush works better.
6,5.0,Washable/reusable,Good use for the stuff that was marketed to us as slime when we were kids *if you grew up in the 80s
7,4.0,Does the job,This product truly does work. However it’s a lot more work then just using a rag. Plus it has an odor not a pleasant one.
8,5.0,The object that I’ve bought is very useful,This was a great product for my vehicle.
9,2.0,Not worth it,You can use any slime home made and I bet it works the same
0,5.0,fun awesome tool to clean,great little slime
1,4.0,Great product!,"Love this product! It helps clean in the tiny areas vacuums just don’t work. As a mother of 3 kids, I use it daily. My kids even love helping me clean my car but only if they can use it!"
2,3.0,It's ok,Only good for loose particles.
3,4.0,Better than Bounty. The quick picker upper!,"Oh my, I need another one. I should have cleaned up as much of the area in my car before using. That’s how great it worked. It got everything! EVERY THING! 😂"
4,5.0,This is for hard to reach incidental dirt pieces,Don't stop using your Norwex Microfibre cloths for the car and spray cleaner. This weird as everything putty gell DOES pick up the dirt and dust in the deeper hard to reach spots but is not to replace regular leather or fabric cleaning in a car for freshness and also stain removal. Ive given decent scores but not 5 because it is bulky and weird to handle in hard to reach areas. Value  is relative. The scent is non existent. There is no scent to this.
5,5.0,Fun and quick,"Arizona is dusty! This works great for a quick clean up on the car console. It’s good at getting into the cup holders, and ac vents , it’s a bit tougher in small cracks, but overall is fun and easy"
6,3.0,it is not worth,came in very hard form and it was difficult to apply and even masaging on the hand smell came out very bad ..it is not at useful and really bad experience
7,4.0,It works pretty good,"It's good for getting in hard to reach spots. Air vents, Cup holders that kind of thing. Biggest selling point for me is when I'm sitting at a light or stuck in a construction zone I open the can and start cleaning/Dusting."
8,2.0,how do you clean it??,confused about this product - all kinds of dirt trapped in it
9,5.0,"Cleaning Gel for car ,Car cleaning","I like cleaning  gel for car , easy to use !"
0,3.0,not the best,the overall concept of the product is great but after one use it gets completely filthy and just makes me not want to use it again. rather vacuum my car than use this.
1,5.0,Good,Good
2,5.0,Clean tiny spots with no effort.,Ease
3,5.0,Easy to use,Used for the car easy
4,3.0,Okay,Doesn’t grab all dirt/dust/debris as shown in video. Okay for the most part.
5,4.0,Does the job,Its easy to use and smells good but it isn’t a slime texture and doesn’t  stretch like I thought it would but it does pick up dust around my car so can’t complain it does the job!  : )
6,5.0,Be Not Afraid:  It Really Works,"If your keyboard looks like mine did, don't be ashamed. I bought this gel upon a review I read. It sat idle for days -- I was afraid to place the blue glop on my keyboard. Once I did, I wondered why I waited. I cleaned each keyboard, tv remote, and dust in hard to reach places. I then took it to my car and each bit of debris in my cup holders disappeared. I LOVE this product and will certainly buy more!"
7,5.0,Easy to use.,Performed as shown on website.
8,5.0,Great product,Easy to use
9,3.0,Quantity is small.  From the picture thought it would be a bigger quantity.,It seems to work ok but quantity is small.  From the picture I thought it would be a bigger amount to work with on projects.  That was disappointing.
0,4.0,Got the job done,"Easy to use, easy to remove. Good value for the money. Wish I had found this sooner."
1,5.0,Cool,Works great
2,4.0,Interesting stuff,Works pretty well but isn’t as “sticky” as I was hoping. So some of the crumbs were falling out and it didn’t get some of the finer dust from the vents either. I’ll keep using and will probably again though 👍🏻👍🏻
3,5.0,Really Works,"I used this to get in the deep cracks on the seats of the cars and all the little nooks that things like to hide in, it really worked great!"
4,3.0,Okaykppl,Like it
5,4.0,gel,was gifted no comment from receiver
6,4.0,This works,Take off a chunk and use it all over the car inside console area.  Maybe reuse it once then discard.  Should get several chunks out of this size can
7,5.0,The Good Blob,"Gross to the touch, but effectively and easily gets all kinds of microscopic crumbs and other things I’d rather not think about out of places they shouldn’t be."
8,5.0,I like it!,It's very easy to use! It's great for getting little things in crevices and in your keyboard!!
9,3.0,eh.  it’s ok,it was ok.  it didn’t really get into the crevices like i was hoping.
0,3.0,Dont leave in car,Was good before it froze and lost a lot of its stickiness
1,3.0,Works good for small creases,"Not as sticky as I’d like, does good at getting dust out of hard to get areas, gets dirty fast and loses ability to pick up dirt and dust. Probably useable 3 times over before it’s done"
2,5.0,cleaning gel,"Wow, this was great for cleaning my computer.  I have not tried in my car yet but I am sure it will work well.Worth the money and a great handy cleaning gel"
3,2.0,Has potential,Love the idea behind it but it leaves slime residue on whatever I’m wiping and my hand.  It might get all the dust and crumbs but then you’re left with cleaning slime off everything.  This is after using twice.
4,4.0,does pick up the bits and pieces,"does pick up the bits and pieces but doesn't get into the minute crevices in the steering wheel. I like it. BUT how do I now clean it?? it is full of cat hair, lint, and other debris"
5,4.0,"Not So Adhesive, Not So Bad","I approve of what this product does, it's a fantastic idea! I just wish that it would do it a little better. If the material was more adhesive, it would easily be a 5/5."
6,5.0,Great product!,I purchased this product primarily to clean out the cup holders on our reclining sofa and to clean our car’s cup holders and console. It worked perfectly!
7,5.0,Perfect for keyboards.,"This cleaned keyboard so well, and so easy to use."
8,4.0,Not so adhesive,"The product works good, but sometimes it requires an extra push to clean some surfaces. The slime is not adhesive enough for a gentle press."
9,5.0,Great product for the car,"This product is great for cleaning dust in the car. Can get mostly everything off. Don’t put on glass or plastic screens, some of it can get stuck on or leave residue."
0,5.0,Works better than I excepted for sure. For the money it’s definitely worth it.,Works better than I excepted for sure. For the money it’s definitely worth it. Fast delivery as well!
1,5.0,Works great!,"Bought this product to clean my mechanical keyboards and it worked great. Haven’t used it in a car yet, but I’m sure it will work just as good."
2,2.0,Disappointed,Could never get it to do what the video showed
3,4.0,IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!,"Love the fact that it gets into unreachable crevices!!! Don't love that there is no way to ""clean"" it and you kind of just use it until it is too gross to use anymore."
4,2.0,Disappointment.,"This was very easy to use, but it did not work well at all in crevices around my middle console and gear shift. It barely got anything out. Like I said in the title, disappointing."
5,4.0,Works pretty well,Basically does what they say. The glob you get is a lot smaller than the one in the picture.
6,4.0,"works, mostly",cleaning cup holders - checkcleaning vents - checkcleaning crevice - no check. after pushing and rubbing it into a crevice most of the dust was left behind and some of the gel.
7,5.0,Silly Stuff Actually Works.,"It takes some maneuvering but once you get going, it does a terrific job getting those hard to reach places on the dashboard and vents. I started using it in the house for lamps, light switches, trophy case, etc. Only caution is it does stick to unfinished wood, but I’ll be using this a lot in the future."
8,5.0,Cleans dust great,Really simple to use take it out roll it across or rub it against some thing that has dust in it do you want to remove it. I use it in my vehicle.
9,5.0,Good stuff!  As sescribed!,"described! Stuff works great!  Only takes a medium size blob to clean up the car, have some for next time!!  Recommend!!"
0,4.0,Affordable and Practical....why didn't I think of this!!??,"Very practical for your keyboards, phones and dashes in your car"
1,2.0,Product open inside shipping box. Made a mess.,Aside from the low quality packaging that was kind of a pain to clean before use... It's good for anything that isn't *stuck* on. Not useful for detailing the inside of a car.
2,3.0,Meh!,Smells really bad.
3,5.0,Good product,Prurchased for Grandson as he had gotten a new car. He loves it. Says it works great and he is all about keeping it clean for the girlfriend ha
4,5.0,Extremely useful gadget...,"For keybord and car dashboard cleaning unbelievably useful - you just do not want to know what's in that thingy, haha!"
5,5.0,Great stuff!,Great stuff! Now I know how the car detailer's get the inside vents and car holders so clean!
6,5.0,Great,"These things are great at dust removal on, anything. And even better the dust takes a while to resettle when removed.After buying and trying one, I had to buy 3 more. I now recommend these things to everyone."
7,5.0,Works Great!,It got all the gunk out of the corners and crevices of my vehicle that i was unable to get with a wipe.
8,5.0,Clings to dirt like nobody’s business,"When I opened this I was excited because now u can clean those small cracks in my keyboards and cars. An example of how well this will attach to dirt and remove it, my youngest son was digging in some rock sand in our backyard when he saw I had bright blue slime he came running and stuck his dirty hands on it. This gel connected to the dirt under his little nails and pulled it straight out. Supremely worth it!!"
9,4.0,Cleans well,"Product is very sticky.  I wasn't sure how much to use.  Overall though, happy with outcome.  Car is very clean.  It got into all the little cracks and crevices."
0,2.0,It didn’t work like I was hoping. It picked up some stuff from cup holder but not all,It didn’t clean like I was hoping. I couldn’t get all of the stuff in the cup holders picked up. It did pick dust off my dash pretty good but you couldn’t rub it or roll it that easy without some jell coming off. It was more of a patting with it. I can clean it faster with a dust rag. The only part was getting dust from areas around the heater vents that helped but still never picked it all up.
1,2.0,"Nice, but only one time use.","Worked great the first time, but once it picked up dirt it would not pick up the dirt like the first time.  If you rinse it, it will go to pieces."
2,2.0,"OK for superficial crumbs, but not deep cleaning or detailing","I purchased this to use on my laptop and in my car.  It is great at picking up any recent superficial crumbs, but the dirt/pieces that were a little deeper it did not pick up.  Would not recommend on any deep cleaning. Perhaps my expectations were a little high."
3,5.0,I will buy for Christmas gift! Great invention,"This is great!! I love it.. I can whip this out at a stoplight, and clean up the dust! I love that I can QUICKLY pick up crumbs from my child. It’s wonderful!! It does NOT stink!!! It have a very non-Existent smell yes! It’s a pleasant smell, but it’s so light that you don’t smell it in your car when you take it out of the jar. I enjoy it and will try it again as a Christmas gift! Great invention"
4,1.0,ok but not the best,its good and works for about 5 seconds before it drops the things you were trying to pick up. It also leaves the residue of the product on everything. I used it in my car and on my laptop and keyboards and i was just left with a little gunk of blue in every corner.
5,5.0,It works well,"I got this for my boyfriend as a christmas gift. He really likes it, and it works super well. The only downside was it got torn apart, and it doesn’t go back together like how slime does so now he has two smaller pieces. although, it still works just as good!!"
6,3.0,Meh. Can’t get it in the crevices.,"Can’t get it into the crevices or cents the way picture showed, so I still have the same annoying dust/debris."
7,3.0,It's okay,"It's okay, just rather wipe ."
8,4.0,Works as much as expected,"Thought I would try this out, and wasn't shocked or disappointed, as I had pretty realistic expectations.  It pulled some stuff out of the hard to reach spots, but not all of it."
9,1.0,Was Great (at first) then Became a Liquid Mess,"At first when I received this gel two months ago I was very happy with it.  I used it two times, separated by one week and was happy with the results.  A month past before I tried to use it again and the gel underwent a profound change, become much more liquid and sticky.  I should have known better but I went ahead and tried to use it to clean my cars cupholder and it became a mess!  It took me nearly an hour using a hot wet towel to clean off the gel!  I am very disappointed!"
0,4.0,It’s basically silly putty.,The stuff worked. If you give them a review you get a 6mo warranty and a free extra one. They didn’t say it had to be a 5-star review so that’s a plus. Only negative is the stuff smells pretty strongly.
1,2.0,Not impressed.  Not great for car,Not as effective as I hoped.  Not much picked up around car console area.  Wouldn't buy again.
2,5.0,very good,works great
3,3.0,Nothing special,I wanted to pick up all the tiny particles in between the slats on my car console...it got stuck and I had to peel it out with a toothpick.It does a fairly decent job of picking up the particles from wide open spaces but I expected it to be easier.  It took more than one swoop to pick up crumbs even after I vacuumed up as much as I could beforehand.
4,5.0,This stuff will melt it left in car,I dislike the fact it does melt the container if left in carI love the fact it gets into deep crevices
5,4.0,a good product overall,i like this product! it really does what it says and picks up all the little dust and crumbs in my car. keeps that new car look! only thing i does like is it does get dirty fast
6,5.0,cleaning crumbs out of little areas.,no
7,2.0,Did not work as expected,"This didn't work as expected. It picked up all the really loose bigger debris but not the really small stuff that was down in the cracks, which is what I thought it was designed to pick up."
8,5.0,Great price,used it for my car interior
9,3.0,"Great for removing debris in small, tight spaces","I used this product to remove debris around console, driving stick shift and air vents in my car. Removed debris easily but I still have to use cloth to clean stains."
0,5.0,Super effective product,"This product is amazing. My car hasn't looked this good since I bought it.The gel is easy to use, leaves no residue, and gets everything out of the slimmest crevice."
1,2.0,Half use - had to throw away,The gel was liquidy at room temp. I had to scrape and wash items (that I could) to remove ample residue. Used it on a few items in my car—realizing it was more trouble than it was worth… threw away.
2,5.0,Excellent for cleaning cracks and cervices in your car,Works exactly as advertised.  Has a faint perfume smell that is pleasant.  I estimate you could get 15-20 uses out of this before having to replace it.Makes car cleaning a breeze.
3,5.0,This stuff works!,This is so easy to use and it works so well.  I’m surprised.
4,2.0,It was ok,"It worked a few times, it doesnt have very many uses. Once things get in it the slime begins to loose its stickyness and you cant wash it. Great idea though"
5,5.0,llega a lugares difíciles donde no es fácil la limpieza,llega a lugares difíciles donde no es fácil la limpieza
6,5.0,Very easy to use.,Very easy to use and you can break it up and just use a little if that’s all you need. It also has a nice smell to it as well.
7,3.0,Looks like a one time usage…,It did a fair job picking up stuff… but trying to remove the filth so it could be used again was impossible….too filthy to use again…!
8,3.0,It did an average job,"It works fine, nothing really special. Could probably just use a rag or towel."
9,2.0,Not that sticky! Pretty useless for cleaning,It is not as sticky as I expect and does not get rid of dust from my keyboard. Smells funny too
0,5.0,Car cleaning,This is a good product to clean your car dash vents .
1,4.0,Cleaning gel,"Okay, haven't used, yet"
2,2.0,Works well once !!,Wish it could somehow be cleaned and reused again. But mine was awful. Maybe a bad batch 🤷‍♀️
3,5.0,Pleased with product and seller,Gets into hard to reach places
4,5.0,Works well.,"Easy to remove from jar. Use a little or alot. Cleans dash,& small places hard to get to."
5,5.0,Works well,Works well
6,5.0,great gooey cleaner,"Stuff feels like the slime I bought for my kids. But it does pick up ""crap"" from my keyboard and on my wife's laptop. So far it has done what they said it would."
7,4.0,What I expected.,Easy to use.
8,4.0,Ok,Ok 👍
9,4.0,Easy to use,Easy to use. Customer service was great. It got lost during transit and they reached out to me to send me a new one for free.
0,4.0,works pretty good.,Works good.
1,5.0,Works great for getting into the little spots,"Works really well, kind of surprised me how well it got into the crevices of the gear shift. I was afraid of it being greasy as some slime products my boys play with can be but it’s very dry so to speak. Did not leave any residue where I used it. Wasn’t sure how to clean it so I just rinsed it in cool water and sort of dabbled it with a paper towel and back to its jar. So far so good."
2,5.0,easy to use,"ease of use, gets where I can't!"
3,1.0,"Does not mold to vents,cracks etc.",It does not flow down in the cracks as pictured. It just rolls on top. Which I could use a cloth and get it cleaned that way. Not the product you think it is or what it will accomplish. Save your money
4,5.0,Great interior car cleaner,This product worked great cleaning crevices and hard to reach places in the car. Would buy again
5,2.0,Too little,It did work for lightly dusty areas.  Not so much in a deep cleaning.  Unless perhaps there was a bit more of the product.  Dirty Very quickly.
6,3.0,Worked okay for a little bit.,"I won't be buying this again.  It worked for a little while, but then got too dirty to work.  It started to fall apart."
7,5.0,Awesome !,Very surprised at how easy it was to open . It smells great!! I’m excited to detail my Jeep and use it !!!
8,5.0,Works,Works good
9,5.0,Solid product!,Great tool for cleaning hard to reach places in the car.
0,5.0,Works good,So far so good no complaints.does as expected.
1,1.0,It smalls bad and leaves a funk on your hands,"This is suppose to make life easier, and sadly it does not. Yes itll clean deep inside stuff, but then i find myself having to wash my hands, and trying to get the funny smell it leaves on me off.  I end up using a microfiber towel instead."
2,5.0,As advertised,I used this in my car around the dashboard. Very easy to use.
3,5.0,Exactly as described,Works just like you’d expect it to.
4,5.0,Cleans hard to reach appliances,Helped so much to clean my computer keyboard and car’s dash and center console
5,4.0,Works,It works for the most part. I did take the advice of other reviews and took little pieces at a time for what I needed to clean my car.
6,5.0,Perfect for cleaning tough to reach spots!,"So glad I bought this! I’ve been cleaning and repairing 90+ year old windows in my home and it’s difficult to get in all the crevices but with this product I was able to easily get out dust and grime from hard to reach places. I’ve kept it stored in a cool location, and have had no issues with pressing it too hard or too deep into cracks. It always comes back as it should."
7,2.0,Just okay,"It was very slimy/watery, nothing like the pictures. I had to keep forming it into a ball or it would just slide through my fingers. It did pick up the dirt but I won’t buy this brand again."
8,4.0,Not as good as I thought it’d be,Does not work as well as I thought it would. Doesn’t pick up in corners very well. Leaves a bunch of dust and dirt behind in my car Center consul.
9,4.0,Good value to clean a car hard to reach places.,Little sticky to use.  Did a good job. I wish there were directions on how to clean the product.  If yhus us not possible I wish that would be indicated.
